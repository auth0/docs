# Block and Unblock Users

You can use the Dashboard to restrict a specific user's access to your application.

## Block a user

To disable a user's access to your apps, you can block the user in the Dashboard:

1. Go to the [Users](${manage_url}/#/users) page in the Dashboard
2. Click the name of the user you want to block
3. When the User Details page opens, click the **Actions** button.
4. Select **Block User** from the dropdown menu.

If a blocked user tries to access an application, they will be redirected to the application with the error message `user is blocked` in the URL.

::: note
Blocking does not expire. You must unblock the user to allow the user to have access to your apps.
