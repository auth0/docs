In a balance between Auth0’s [load testing policy](/policies/load-testing) and the desire to load test, it is common practice among Auth0’s customers to mock out Auth0’s endpoints. This is a valuable practice in order to ensure that your application works with your expected interfaces without having to restrict your testing, and tools such as [MockServer](http://www.mock-server.com/), [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) or even [Postman](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/mock_servers/setting_up_mock/) can be used to assist.
