Auth0 will *not* communicate with the upstream IdP if there is an active SSO session with Auth0, unless you force it with a `prompt=login`. If one of your customer organizations can not manage logout for those users, they may still have access after they’ve been decommissioned. Depending on the IdP, if Auth0 gets a token for their API, you can request information about the user from the IdP in a [rule](/rules) to poll whether that user should still have access or not. If you don’t have this ability, you will have to provide your customer organizations a way to trigger a block or decommission of users in your system either through an API call or a UI.
