# CMS Identity Plugins

Auth0 provides Content Management System Plugins/Extensions to integrate your CMS installation with your Auth0 account. These plugins enable <dfn data-key="single-sign-on">Single Sign-on (SSO)</dfn> for Enterprises, social login and user/password login through all your instances and platforms.

Login features are implemented through a new Login Widget (powered by Auth0) that enables:

- SSO with Enterprise Directories (LDAP, AD, G Suite, Office365 and <dfn data-key="security-assertion-markup-language">SAML</dfn> Provider)
- Shared User/Password between multiple WordPress accounts for SSO
- SSO with over 30 [Social Providers](/identityproviders)
- User Management Dashboard
- Optional Two Factor Authentication
- SSO between WordPress and other applications
- Reporting and Analytics
