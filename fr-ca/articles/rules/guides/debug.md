# Debug Rules

To debug any [Rule](/rules) you have created in Auth0, you can use `console.log` from within your rule code. You can see `console.log` output by using the [**Try this Rule** feature](#try-this-rule), viewing the logs available with the [Real-time Webtask Logs extension](#real-time-logs-extension), or for legacy clients, using the [Debug Rule CLI](#debug-rule-cli).

## Try this Rule

In the [Rules Editor](${manage_url}/#/rules/create), the **TRY THIS RULE** button lets you run a Rule in isolation with mock **user** and **context** objects. Clicking **TRY** will run the Rule with those two objects as input and will display any `console.log` output.

::: note
The **TRY THIS RULE** feature functions outside a specific client context. When using this feature, you may run into issues if your Rule depends on data that would be provided when called from an actual application.

## Real-time logs extension

The [Real-time Webtask Logs](/extensions/realtime-webtask-logs) extension displays all logs in real-time for all custom code in your account, which includes all `console.log` output and exceptions.

## Debug Rule CLI

<%= include('../../_includes/_webtask') %>

In the [Rules Editor](${manage_url}/#/rules/create)], the **DEBUG RULE** button displays instructions for installing, configuring, and running the [webtask CLI](https://github.com/auth0/wt-cli) for debugging Rules. Paste these commands into a terminal to see the `console.log` output and any unhandled exceptions that occur during Rule execution.

For example:

```sh
  ~  npm install -g wt-cli
  ~  wt init --container "youraccount" --url "https://sandbox.it.auth0.com" --token "eyJhbGci...WMPGI" -p "youraccount-default-logs"
  ~  wt logs -p "youraccount-default-logs"
  [18:45:38.179Z]  INFO wt: connected to streaming logs (container=youraccount)
  [18:47:37.954Z]  INFO wt: webtask container assigned
  [18:47:38.167Z]  INFO wt: ---- checking email_verified for some-user@mail.com! ----
```

This debugging method works for Rules tried from the Dashboard and for those actually running during user authentication.
