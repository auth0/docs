Once the new ${application_type} Application is created, you will be redirected to the Application's settings. Available tabs include:

* **Settings**: Shows all available [settings](/dashboard/reference/settings-application#advanced-settings) for your application. By default, most of the settings will be created for you.
* **Quick Start**: Shows all the available examples for ${application_type} applications. It also shows you how you can call your API using various technologies. To learn how to accept and validate Access Tokens in your API, see our [Backend/API Quickstarts](/quickstart/backend).
* **APIs**: Allows you to authorize additional APIs for use with your Application.
