When building Auth0 products, we resolve to

* deliver value to customers early and often, iterating based on their feedback
* seek a deep understanding of our customers and consider them in every decision
* relentlessly acquire and analyze data, so we can make better choices
* visualize and design for current, idealized, and future versions of our whole product when adding features

To best serve these goals, we apply an iterative approach to product delivery, including an iterative product release lifecycle that allows us to introduce and improve upon new functionality.
