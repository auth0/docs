::: panel Turn off Cloudflare CNAME Flattening
Cloudflare uses a feature called CNAME Flattening, which affects Auth0 verification and certificate renewal in the way that it handles DNS records. With CNAME flattening enabled, Auth0 will be unable to renew your certificates. For details, see [Cloudflare documentation](https://support.cloudflare.com/hc/en-us/articles/200169056-Understand-and-configure-CNAME-Flattening).
