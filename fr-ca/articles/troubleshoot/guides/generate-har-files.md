# Generate and Analyze HAR Files

A [HAR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.har) (HTTP Archive) file shows the sequence of redirects that happen during a login transaction. It's an excellent tool for debugging authentication issues, as it can identify where things get stuck. A HAR file is a JSON formatted log of a web browser's interactions with a web server. If authentication isn't working as expected, you can generate and analyze HAR files to find issues. Including a HAR file in your [support requests](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}) can help speed up the troubleshooting process.

::: warning
Before sending the HAR file to Auth0, ensure that you remove or obfuscate any sensitive information (such as passwords and client secrets) using a text editor.

9. Save the HAR file. 

### Safari

2. Choose **File > Open New Private Window**.
3. Visit the web page where the issue occurs.

7. Save the HAR file.

## Analyze HAR files

1. To view the HAR file, use a tool such as [Google's HAR Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/). 
2. Analyze the list of web requests captured in the HAR file. In particular, check the sequence of redirects to see how far you get in the authentication process. This helps identify where the issue is happening. 
3. Compare the sequence of redirects to the expected sequence for your authentication flow.

    For example:

    * There should be a call to the `/authorize` endpoint to start the authentication flow.
    * There may be redirects to remote identity providers to prompt the user to log in.
    * Then there should be a redirect back to Auth0 `/login/callback` (`https://login.auth0.com/login/callback`).
    * Then there should be a redirect back to your applicationâ€™s callback URL.
