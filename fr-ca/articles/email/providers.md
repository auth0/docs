# Use Your Own SMTP Email Provider

Auth0 allows you to configure your own SMTP email provider so you can more completely manage, monitor, and troubleshoot your email communications.

::: note
Auth0's built-in email infrastructure should be used for testing-level emails only.
:::

Auth0 currently supports the following providers:

* [Amazon SES](#configure-amazon-ses)
* [Mandrill](#configure-mandrill)
* [SendGrid](#configure-sendgrid)
* [SparkPost](#configure-sparkpost)
* [Mailgun](#configure-mailgun)
* [Other SMTP](#configure-a-custom-smtp-server) (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo)

You can only configure one email provider, which will be used for all emails.

## Whitelist IP addresses

To ensure that emails can be sent from Auth0 to your SMTP, you must open the right ports and allow inbound connections from specific IP addresses. To get the list of IPs, navigate to [Dashboard > Emails > Provider](${manage_url}/#/templates/provider).

## Configure Amazon SES

To use the Amazon SES API to send emails, you must complete several configuration steps. First, though, you need to decide which credentials you want to use:

* API Credentials
* SMTP Credentials (the secret is usually 44 characters long)

For more info about SES credentials, see Amazon's [Using Credentials With Amazon SES](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-credentials.html).

### Use API credentials

1. Sign up for an [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/) account, or log in.

2. [Verify your domain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html).

3. [Verify email addresses](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-email-addresses.html)    

4. [Request production access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html?icmpid=docs_ses_console).

5. [Get your AWS access keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/get-aws-keys.html). Copy these keys; you will need to enter these values into Auth0.

6. [Attach a policy with the proper permissions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage.html). Attach a policy with the `ses:SendRawEmail` and `ses:SendEmail` permissions, as in this example:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ses:SendRawEmail",
                "ses:SendEmail"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

7. Navigate to Auth0 [Custom Email Providers](${manage_url}/#/emails/provider). Activate the **Use my own email provider** toggle, and click the **Amazon Web Services** logo.

    ![Select Email Provider](/media/articles/dashboard/emails/providers/emails-providers-list.png)

8. Provide a **From** email address, enter your AWS **Access Key Id** and **Secret Access Key**, select your **Region**, and click **Save**:

    ![Enter AWS API Email Provider Values](/media/articles/dashboard/emails/providers/emails-providers-settings-aws.png)

You can now send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button. If you have configured everything correctly, you will receive a confirmation email. If you do not receive an email after a few minutes, please check your [Auth0 logs](${manage_url}/#/logs) for any failures.

The [Amazon SES console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ses) will now display delivery insights for all emails that have been sent to your users.

## Configure a custom SMTP server

When using your own SMTP server to send email, the server must:

* support LOGIN [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP_Authentication).

* use a certificate signed by a public certificate authority (CA).
