# Configure Refresh Token Rotation

Configure Refresh Token Rotation for each application using the Dashboard or the auth-spa-js SDK. When Refresh Token Rotation is enabled, the transition for the end-user is seamless. The application uses the previous non-rotating Refresh Token which has expired and swaps it for a rotating Refresh Token. 

Migration scenarios accommodate automatic token revocation when migrating from a non-rotating Refresh Token to a rotating Refresh Token and vice-versa.

- Exchanging a non-rotating Refresh Token when Refresh Token Rotation is enabled deletes all the non-rotating tokens issued for the same `client_id`, resource server, and user and tenant.
- Exchanging a rotating Refresh Token when Refresh Token Rotation is disabled issues a non-rotating Refresh Token and revokes the Rotating Refresh Token family.

## Using the Dashboard

1. Go to [Dashboard > Application Settings](${manage_url}/#/applications). Scroll to the **Application Tokens** section. Set **Refresh Token Behavior** to **Rotating**. 

    ![Application Token Settings - Rotating Refresh Tokens](/media/articles/tokens/rotating-tokens.png)

2. Set **Refresh Token Lifetime (Absolute)** for when a Refresh Token will expire in seconds. 

    The Refresh Token lifetime is the *absolute* lifetime that Refresh Tokens can be used to get new Access Tokens, after which time, the user has to re-authenticate. The default Refresh Token expiration period is 30 days (2592000 seconds). You can configure up to 90 days (7776000 seconds). *The lifetime does not extend when tokens are rotated.* 

3. Set **Refresh Token Reuse Interval** to allow a reuse interval for a Refresh Token to account for lag between request and response time due to the end-user's network, device, and/or location (in seconds). 

4. Click **Save Changes**.

::: note
Refresh Token Rotation is only supported for OIDC-conformant applications having the Refresh Token grant type enabled.

## Using the Auth0 SPA SDK

You can also use the Auth0 SPA SDK to enable Refresh Token rotation:

1. Install the latest version of the `auth0-spa-js` SDK.

    ```text
    npm install @auth0/auth0-spa-js
    ```

2. Enable the feature on the SDK by setting `useRefreshTokens: true` to start sending the `offline_access` scope.

    ```js
    const auth0 = await createAuth0Client({
      domain: '<YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN>',
      client_id: '<YOUR CLIENT ID>',
      audience: '<YOUR API IDENTIFIER>',
      useRefreshTokens: true
    });
    ```

3. Configure the Refresh Token rotation settings. For example:  

    ```js
    PATCH /api/v2/clients/{client_id}
    {
      "refresh_token": {
        "rotation_type": "rotating",
        "expiration_type": "expiring",
        "token_lifetime": "2592000",
        "leeway": 3
      }
    }
    ```

    | Attribute | Description |
    | -- | -- |
    | `rotation_type` | Text string: "rotating" or "non-rotating" |
    | `expiration_type` | Text string: "expiring" or "non-expiring" |
    | `token_lifetime` | The default Refresh Token expiration period, when Refresh Token Rotation is enabled, is 30 days (2592000 seconds). You can configure up to 90 days (7776000 seconds). **The lifetime does not extend when tokens are rotated.** |
    | `leeway` | Allow the same Refresh Token to be used within the time period to account for potential network concurrency issues that would otherwise invalidate the token should the client attempt to retry using the same Refresh Token. By default leeway is disabled. Configurable in seconds. |

    ::: panel What is *leeway*?
    The concept of *leeway* is to avoid concurrency issues when exchanging the Rotating Refresh Token multiple times within a given timeframe. During the leeway window which is configurable on a per second basis, the breach detection features don't apply and therefore a new rotating Refresh Token is issued. Only the previous token can be reused, meaning if the second to last one is exchanged, the breach detection will apply.

## Refresh Tokens and reuse detection

If a previously invalidated token is used, the entire set of Refresh Tokens issued since that invalidated token was issued will immediately be revoked along with the grant, requiring the end-user to re-authenticate. See [Automatic Reuse Detection](/tokens/concepts/refresh-token-rotation#automatic-reuse-detection) for an example.
