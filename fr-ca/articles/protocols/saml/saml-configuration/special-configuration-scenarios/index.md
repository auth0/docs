# Special Configuration Scenarios

Once you've set up a basic <dfn data-key="security-assertion-markup-language">SAML</dfn> Integration, there are a number of additional requirements you might need to implement so that your integration reflects your needs and requirements.

## Prerequisites

This article assumes that you've already set up a [Connection](/protocols/saml/saml-configuration/auth0-as-service-provider) or an [Application](/protocols/saml/saml-configuration/auth0-as-identity-provider).

The instructions below assume that you're altering specific settings for an existing SAML integration, not configuring an integration from scratch.

## Scenarios

* [IdP-Initiated SSO](/protocols/saml/saml-configuration/special-configuration-scenarios/idp-initiated-sso)
* [Signing and Encrypting SAML Requests](/protocols/saml/saml-configuration/special-configuration-scenarios/signing-and-encrypting-saml-requests)
