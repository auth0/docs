# Hooks

<%= include('../_includes/_ip_whitelist') %>

Hooks are secure, self-contained functions that allow you to customize the behavior of Auth0 when executed for selected [extensibility points](/hooks/extensibility-points) of the Auth0 platform. Auth0 invokes Hooks during runtime to execute your custom Node.js code.

Whether Hooks can be used with connections varies according to extensibility point. Hooks that can be used with connections only work with [Database Connections](/connections/database) and [Passwordless Connections](/connections/passwordless).

## Manage Hooks

You can create, update, delete, enable/disable, and view Hooks from the Dashboard or Management API. To learn more, see:

- [Create Hooks](/hooks/create)
- [Update Hooks](/hooks/update)
- [Delete Hooks](/hooks/delete)
- [Enable/Disable Hooks](/hooks/enable-disable)
- [View Hooks](/hooks/view)

Hooks may also be imported and exported using the [Deploy Command-Line Interface (CLI) Extension](/extensions/deploy-cli).

<%= include('./_includes/_handle_rate_limits') %>

## Manage Hook Secrets

Hooks feature integrated secret management to securely store secrets while making them conveniently available in code. To learn more, see [Hook Secrets](/hooks/secrets).

## Test Hooks

The Hooks editor in the Dashboard has an integrated Runner, which allows you to test your code without leaving the editor.

<%= include('./_includes/_test_runner_save_warning') %>

## View Logs

You can view real-time logging information for specific configured Hooks using the Dashboard. To learn more, see [View Logs for Hooks](/hooks/view-logs).
