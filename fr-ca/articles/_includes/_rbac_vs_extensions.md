::: warning
The [Authorization Core](/authorization/guides/how-to) feature set and [Authorization Extension](/extensions/authorization-extension) are completely separate features. To manage groups, roles, or permissions, you will need to use the feature they were originally created in.

Although the [Delegated Administration Extension](/extensions/delegated-admin) and the [Authorization Core](/authorization/guides/how-to) feature set are completely separate features, you can use the Authorization Core feature set to create and manage roles for the DAE if you use a rule. To learn how, see [Sample Use Cases: Rules with Authorization](/authorization/concepts/sample-use-cases-rules#manage-delegated-administration-extension-roles-using-the-authorization-core-feature-set).
