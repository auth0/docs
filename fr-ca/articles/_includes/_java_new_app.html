  <p>Create an <a href="${manage_url}/login">Auth0 account</a> (or login) and an authentication application instance from your <a href="${manage_url}/#/">dashboard</a>. Once you create an app, you'll be provided with credentials (Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret) which should be stored somewhere safe (do not commit this information to your git repo!). You can start by downloading the sample after you login as it is configured with your Default App credentials</p>
