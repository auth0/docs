# Tenant Restoration Policy

::: warning
**Deleted tenants cannot be restored** and the **tenant name may not be used again** when creating new tenants.
:::

**Before you delete your tenant, please check out the following resources for alternative options:**
* [Updating a Tenant Admin](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/manage-dashboard-admins#update-admin) **for changing ownership of the tenant**
* [Delete or Reset Tenants](/tutorials/delete-reset-tenant) for reseting tenant configuration.

If you've deleted your tenant, and you require the use of a particular domain name, we recommend configuring a [custom domain name](/custom-domains) for your new tenant.
