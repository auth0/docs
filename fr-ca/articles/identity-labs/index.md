# Auth0 Identity Labs

<i class="icon icon-budicon-529"></i> **Welcome to the home for Auth0's digital identity labs!** These exercises serve as a learning tool to be combined with our [Learn Identity video series](/videos/learn-identity). Each lab is meant to be completed once a video (or series of videos) is complete.

_A few general things to keep in mind as you work through these labs:_

**Plan to take around 1 hour or so (longer depending on your coding experience) for each lab.** Optionally, video demonstrations of the lab exercises are available.

**These labs are designed to illustrate the basic concepts of digital identity, OAuth, and OpenID Connect.** The goal is to see the parameters and data that come together to create a complete authentication flow. As such, take your time and read through each section carefully. Completing the lab successfully is less important than understanding the concepts within.

**The code samples here should not be used as-is in a production app.** The code here was written for instructional purpose and simplicity. For guidance on integrating Auth0 with a new or existing app, please see the Quickstarts listed on our [documentation home page](/) (choose an application type, then the technology you're using).

Each lab will have a list of pre-requisites to complete or install. Please take note of specific version numbers as these can have an effect on how the labs work.

‚ÑπÔ∏è The error messages displayed in the browser and in the console can often clue you into something that is going wrong. Auth0 error pages typically include a link under the "Technical Details" header that will give you more information about what went wrong. A "SyntaxError" line in your terminal window when starting the server indicates a typo or missed line.

‚ÑπÔ∏è The code samples will indicate what lines to add or modify. In most cases, the order of operations (as in, when a particular line of code runs) matters greatly, so pay attention to those lines and the description above each snippet.

```js
// lab-01/begin/server.js
// üëÜ That is the file you should be in for these changes.

require('dotenv').config();
// üëÜ This is code that should not be changed.

// ... other required packages
// üëÜ This is information to help you place the new code.

// Add the code below üëá
const session = require('cookie-session');
const { auth } = require('express-openid-connect');
// üëÜ This is what should be added

// ...
// üëÜ This indicates that there is other code after that should not be changed.
```

‚ÑπÔ∏è Terminal commands are proceeded by a `‚ùØ` character. If you're copying those commands, exclude that character and the space that follows. Exclude all lines that do not start with `‚ùØ`; those are there to show the expected output.

```text
# This line is informational; read but don't use.
‚ùØ this line is the command to copy

This line shows sample output; read but don't use.
```

**And with that, let's get started!**
