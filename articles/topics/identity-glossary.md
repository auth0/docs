  - tokens/access-token#access-token-format
  Audience: A parameter set during authorization, which contains the unique identifier of the target API. This is how you tell Auth0 for which API to issue an Access Token (in other words, which is the intended audience of this token).

  - users/redirecting-users
  Callback URL: The URL that Auth0 invokes after the authentication process. Auth0 redirects back to this URL and appends additional parameters to it.

  - scopes/current#standard-claims
  Claim: A declaration about a subject that is supposed to be true and trusted depending on the identity provider. This declaration could be an attribute such as name, role, or permission.

  - applications
  Client: An application that obtains information from a server for local use. This is the application that you are configuring for use with Auth0.

  - applications/application-settings/native#settings
  Client ID: The unique identifier for your application. This is the ID you will use with when configuring authentication with Auth0. It is generated by the system when you create a new application and it cannot be modified.

  - applications/application-settings/native#settings
  Client Secret: A string known only to the application and the authorization server. Think of it as your application's password which must be kept confidential at all times. If anyone gains access to your Client Secret, they can impersonate your application and access protected resources.
