# Extensibility

## Rules

[Rules](/rules) are functions written in JavaScript that are executed in Auth0 as part of the transaction every time a user authenticates to your application. Rules allow you to easily customize and extend Auth0's capabilities. Rules can be chained together for modular coding and can be turned on and off individually.

## Hooks

[Hooks](/hooks) allow you to customize the behavior of Auth0 using Node.js code that is executed against extensibility points (which are comparable to webhooks that come with a server). Hooks allow you modularity when configuring your Auth0 implementation, and extend the functionality of base Auth0 features.

## Extensions

[Auth0 Extensions](/extensions) enable you to install applications or run commands/scripts that extend the functionality of the Auth0 base product.
