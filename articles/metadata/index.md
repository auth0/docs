# User Metadata

Auth0 allows you to store **metadata**, or data related to each user that has not come from the identity provider. There are two kinds of metadata:

* **user\_metadata**: stores user attributes (such as user preferences) that do not impact a user's core functionality;
* **app\_metadata**: stores information (such as a user's support plan, security roles, or access control groups) that can impact a user's core functionality, such as how an application functions or what the user can access.

**NOTE**: An authenticated user can modify data in their profile's `user_metadata`, but not in their `app_metadata`.

### How to Read, Create or Edit Metadata

You can manage your metadata by either:

* [Using Rules](/rules/metadata-in-rules)
* [Auth0 APIs](/metadata/management-api)

## Metadata Usage

Suppose the following data is stored for a user with the email address `jane.doe@example.com`:

```json
{
    "emails": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "user_metadata": {
        "hobby": "surfing"
    },
    "app_metadata": {
        "plan": "full"
    }
}
```

**NOTE**: Any valid JSON snippet can be used as metadata.

To read metadata, simply access the correct property. For example, if you want to work with the values of the following properties in your [Rules](/rules) or via a call to the [Management API](/api/management/v2):

```js
console.log(user.email); // "jane.doe@example.com"
console.log(user.user_metadata.hobby); // "surfing"
console.log(user.app_metadata.plan); // "full"
```

**NOTE**: With Management APIv1, all metadata was stored in the `metadata` field. Data stored in this field is now available under `app_metadata`.

### Naming Metadata Fields

Metadata field names must not contain a dot. For example, use of the following returns a Bad Request (400) error:

```json
{
    "preference.color": "pink"
}
```

One way of handling this is to nest attributes:

```json
    {
        "preference": {
            "color": "pink"
        }
    }
```

Alternately, you can use any delimiter that is not  `.` or `$`.

However, the usage of the `.` delimiter is acceptable in the data values:

```json
{
    "preference": "light.blue"
}
```

## Restrictions

The following fields may not be stored in the `app_metadata` field:

* `blocked`
* `clientID`
* `created_at`
* `email`
* `email_verified`
* `global_client_id`
* `globalClientID`
* `identities`
* `lastIP`
* `lastLogin`
* `metadata`
* `user_id`
* `loginsCount`

### Metadata Size Limits

Currently, Auth0 limits the total size of your user metadata to 16 MB. However, when using Rules and/or the Management Dashboard, your metadata limits may be lower.

When setting this field with the [Authentication API Signup endpoint](/api/authentication?javascript#signup) size is limited to no more than 10 fields and must be less than 500 characters.
