This quickstart guide demonstrates how to add authentication to an Angular 1.x application using Auth0.

Auth0 provides wrappers for using the [Lock widget](https://auth0.com/lock) and the [auth0.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js) library in Anguar apps, and these wrappers will be used throughout these quickstart guides.

## Sample Projects

If you want to follow along with these quickstart guides, you can download the starter [seed project](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-angularjs-sample/tree/master/00-Starter-Seed) to work from a blank slate. This seed project is a basic Angular 1.x application with all the Bower dependencies included and the required references added to the `index.html` file.

Each step in the quickstarts contains a sample project available for download which shows the finished result for that step.
