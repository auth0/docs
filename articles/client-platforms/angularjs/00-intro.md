This is the very beginning of a simple, practical and multi-step quickstart that will guide you through managing authentication in your Angular JS apps with Auth0.

Auth0 provides and manages an [AngularJS SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular). This SDK wraps Auth0's [Lock Widget](https://github.com/auth0/lock) and [Auth0.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js) which makes it easy to use any of them. It uses which ever is included in your project or Lock if both are included. It is also important to keep in mind before we get down to business that Auth0 supports authentication in both redirect and pop-up modes. It is important because SPAs do not retain states after a page reloads (as well as redirect) but the SDK makes tackling this situation simple as you will see soon.

## Seed &amp; Samples

There are two options to following along these steps. You can either download the [seed project](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-angularjs-sample/tree/master/00-Starter-Seed) or the samples. The seed is a regular angular app with nothing on Auth0 in it except for the dependencies included in the HTML. It just serves as a starting point as well building blocks for this quickstart. The samples are included in each step and contains the example for each of the step.

## Prerequisites
Before we embark on this journey of ours, it is important to setup our application buy following these process:

You can skip this step if you think you can find your way around or just looking for something specific in the quickstart.

### 1. Create an Application

<%= include('../../_includes/_new_app') %>_

### 2. Configure Callback URLs
Callback URLs are URLs that Auth0 invokes after the authentication process. Auth0 routes your application back to this URL and attaches some details to it including a token. Callback URLs can be manipulated on the fly and that could be harmful. For security reasons, you will need to add your application's URL in the app's `Allowed Callback URLs`. This will enable Auth0 to recognize the URLs as valid. If omitted, authentication will not be successful for the app instance.

### 3. Structure
Throughout the steps, the seed and samples will have the following directory structure:
```bash
|---home
|------home.html
|------home.js
|---login
|------login.html
|------login.js
|---settings
|------settings.html
|------settings.js
|---app.js
|---index.html
```

### 4. Dependencies
Some JavaScript dependencies are required for Auth0 to work as expected in an Angular app. Include the dependencies' scripts in your `index.html`:

${snippet(meta.snippets.dependencies)}

These may seem like a lot of dependencies, but each one has a very important function. Go through and figure out if each package works for your use case. Feel free to strip off the unnecessary packages.

 - **lock** is the default authentication widget provided by Auth0. It is completely optional but I suggest you stick to it as an Auth0 newbie.
 - **auth0.js** is Auth0's javascript library. This is not necessary if you choose to use Lock throughout.
 - **angular** is Angular's main library which you are building the application on.
 - **angular-cookies** is Angular's wrapper for managing client cookies.
 - **angular-route** is used to mange SPA routes in Angular application.
 - **auth0-angular**: Auth0's SDK for Angular. Exposes most of the useful methods for authentication
 - **angular-storage**: A `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` wrapper create with love by Auth0 team.
 - **angular-jwt**: Angular service that makes using JWT easy in Angular apps.

The seed project already have this files included, injected into angular (where applicable) and ready for use.

### 5. Viewport
Right after including the scripts, add a viewport to make the lock widget fit in to device widths:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no" />
```

With all that, our entire `<head>` will look like this:
