# Manage Organization Membership

Each organization has its own associated members, which represent the users who will be allowed to log in through its configured login page.

SaaS and B2B applications are usually provided to teams rather than to isolated individual users. In this context, a team could be an entire company, a small set of employees (for example, the marketing department), or even a transient group of users that are organized around a purpose (for example, a group of neighbors who have signed up to work with a charity and are competing as a team to raise the most money for a cause).

Organizations in Auth0 are flexible enough to support all of these use cases, but require some planning when building an application that supports teams. One of the first things to consider is how to manage team membership, which you can accomplish by:

* [Directly managing membership via the Management API or Auth0 Dashboard](#manage-members-directly)
* [Granting just-in-time membership](#grant-just-in-time-membership) to users that log in via an enabled connection
* [Inviting users via email](#invite-users)

Once membership is defined, you can [retrieve membership for organizations](#retrieve-organization-membership) and [manage organization-specific role assignments](#manage-roles-assigned-to-members) for members.

## Manage members directly

To manage members directly, you can use either the Auth0 Dashboard or the Management API.

### Assign members

To assign a member to your organization, you must have already [created the user](/users/create-users) in your tenant. If you cannot find a user, you can [invite them](#invite-members) instead.

#### Auth0 Dashboard

To assign members via the Auth0 Dashboard:

1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Organizations](${manage_url}/#/organizations), and select the organization for which you want to configure membership.
2. Select the **Members** view, select **Add members**, and select **Add Users**.
3. Enter the name(s) of the user you would like to assign as a member to the organization, and select **Add user(s) to organization**.

#### Management API

To assign members via the Management API:

Make a `POST` call to the `Create Organization Members` endpoint. Be sure to replace `ORG_ID`, `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `USER_ID` placeholder values with your organization ID, Management API Access Token, and user IDs, respectively.

```har
{
   "method": "POST",
   "url": "https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/api/v2/organizations/ORG_ID/members",
 "headers": [
   { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" },
   { "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" },
   { "name": "Cache-Control", "value": "no-cache" }
   ],
   "postData": {
   "mimeType": "application/json",
   "text" : "{ \"members\": [ \"USER_ID\", \"USER_ID\", \"USER_ID\" ] }"
   }
}
```

<%= include('./_includes/_find_domain') %>

| Value | Description |
| - | - |
| `ORG_ID` | ID of the organization for which you want to assign membership. |
| `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` | [Access Token for the Management API](/tokens/management-api-access-tokens) with the scope `create:organization_members`. |
| `USER_ID` | ID of the user(s) you want to assign to the specified organization. Maximum of 10 members per organization. | 

##### Response status codes

Possible response status codes are as follows:

| Status code | Error code | Message | Cause |
| - | - | - | - |
| `204` | | Members successfully added to organization. | |
| `400` | `invalid_body` | Invalid request body. The message will vary depending on the cause. | The request payload is not valid. |
| `400` | `invalid_query_string` | Invalid request query string. The message will vary depending on the cause. | The query string is not valid. |

| `429` | | Too many requests. Check the X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-RateLimit-Reset headers. | | 

### Remove members
 
You can remove members from organizations using either the Auth0 Dashboard or the Management API. Remember that removing the user from the organization will not delete it from any connections.
 
#### Auth0 Dashboard
 
To remove a member via the Auth0 Dashboard:
 
1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Organizations](${manage_url}/#/organizations), and select the organization for which you want to configure membership.
2. Select the **Members** view, locate the member you want to remove, and expand its **More Options** (**...**) menu.
3. Select **Remove member**, and confirm.
 
#### Management API
 
To remove members via the Management API:
 
Make a `DELETE` call to the `Delete Organization Members` endpoint. Be sure to replace the `ORG_ID`, `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `USER_ID` placeholder values with your organization ID, Management API Access Token, and user ID, respectively.
 
```har
{
   "method": "DELETE",
   "url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/organizations/ORG_ID/members",

| `429` | | Too many requests. Check the X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-RateLimit-Reset headers. | |

## Grant just-in-time membership

[Granting just-in-time membership](#grant-just-in-time-membership) to users that log in via an enabled connection

To automatically grant membership when users log in to an organization, you must first [configure and enable a connection](/organizations/configure-connections) for the organization. While enabling your connection, select **Enable Auto-Membership** to allow all users logging in with the connection to be automatically added as members of this organization.

## Invite users
 
If you would like to assign a member to your organization, but the user does not yet exist in your data store, you can invite them to your organization. In this case, the user will receive an email containing a link that will allow them to log in to the organization using a configured connection.

For the user invitation flow to work properly, you must:

1. [Integrate the membership invitation flow into your application](#integrate-the-membership-invitation-flow-into-your-application)
2. [Customize the user invitation flow](#customize-the-user-invitation-flow)
3. [Send membership invitations](#send-membership-invitations)

::: panel Limitations
* User invitations can only be sent via email
* Invited users must log in or create an account with the email address to which the invitation was sent
:::
 
### Integrate the membership invitation flow into your application

For user invitations to work, you must set up a route in your application as part of the invitation acceptance flow and configure an associated [default login route](/universal-login/configure-default-login-routes) for your tenant or application. A link to the configured URI will be included in the email invitation that is sent to users.

#### Configure the URI

If the URI should be shared across all of your applications, you can set the **Tenant Login URL** at [Auth0 Dashboard > Settings > Advanced](${manage_url}/#/tenant/advanced). Otherwise, you can set the URI on a per-application basis by using **Application Login URI** in your application's settings, which you can reach from [Auth0 Dashboard > Applications > Applications](${manage_url}/#/applicatons).

#### Specify route behavior

The route in your application must accept `invitation` and `organization` parameters through the query string. To start the invitation acceptance transaction, it should forward both parameters along with the end-user to your Auth0 `/authorize` endpoint. 

::: note
To support multi-tenant scenarios where the organization name is used as a subdomain or path variable in your application (for example, `acme.myapp.com`), an `organization_name` parameter is also included in the invitation link sent to users. This parameter does not need to be sent to `/authorize`.
:::

For example, if you have an organization-enabled application with an **Application Login URI** set to `https://myapp.com/login`, then the link sent in the email invitation that an end-user receives will be: `https://myapp.com/login?invitation={invitation_ticket_id}&organization={organization_id}&organization_name={organization_name}`.

Your application should initiate a transaction to `/authorize` that contains the provided `invitation` and `organization` key-value pairs.

### Customize the user invitation flow

::: note
To customize the user invitation flow, you must use custom domains, which is a feature of any paid pricing plan.
:::

To customize the user invitation prompt and email that the user receives, modify the Universal Login prompt and email templates. For more information, see the following pages:

* [Universal Login Page Templates](/universal-login/new-experience/universal-login-page-templates)
* [Universal Login Internationalization](/universal-login/universal-login-internationalization)
* [Customize Email Templates](/auth0-email-services/customize-email-templates)

#### Localization

When localizing the user invitation flow, you will need to use the `user_metadata` parameter, which is an optional parameter in the invitation ticket.

You can access this parameter through the **User Invitation** email template and use the same logic as you would with other [multilingual email templates](/auth0-email-services/customize-email-templates#multilingual-email-templates).

To localize the invitation prompt, your application or browser will need to ensure the `ui_locales` or `Accept-Language` header is set properly.

### Send membership invitations 
 
You can send organization membership invitations to users using either the Auth0 Dashboard or the Management API.

Invitation Expiration: The default invitation TTL is 7 days. You can change this in with the parameter: ttl_sec (integer, optional): Number of seconds for which the invitation is valid before expiration. If unspecified or set to 0, this value defaults to 604800 seconds (7 days).  Upper limit on ttl_sec is 30 days.
Currently we do not support patching or resending an expired invite. A new invitation needs to be generated after an invite expires.
 
#### Auth0 Dashboard
 
To invite members via the Auth0 Dashboard:
 
1. Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Organizations](${manage_url}/#/organizations), and select the organization for which you want to configure membership.
2. Select the **Members** view, select **Add members**, and select **Invite Users**.
3. Enter the names of the user you would like to invite to the organization, and select **Add user(s) to organization**.
 
#### Management API

::: warning
If you are exposing the invitation feature from an admin dashboard you have custom developed for your application, be sure to use a confidential client to validate that the authenticated user is inviting new members to an organization to which they already belong, or restrict the ability to invite others to only members with a specific assigned role.
:::
 
To invite members via the Management API:
 
Make a `POST` call to the `Create Organization Invitations` endpoint. Be sure to replace `ORG_ID`, `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `NAME_OF_USER`, `EMAIL_ADDRESS`, `CLIENT_ID`, `CONNECTION_ID`, `EXP_TIME`, and `ROLE_ID` placeholder values with your organization ID, Management API Access Token, name of invited user, email address of invited user, client ID, connection ID, expiration time, and role IDs, respectively.
