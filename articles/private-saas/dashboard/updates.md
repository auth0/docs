## Online Update
The Online Update section allows you to download and install updates from the Auth0 mirror site. This is the recommended way of updating.

You will be asked to provide the *build number* you would like to apply in the **Update To** field. You may select a provided version, or you may provide a custom *build number*.

Once you have selected the appropriate build, any **release notes** applicable will display on the screen.

To begin the update, click on "Update from Internet." You will be prompted once more to confirm to ensure that the appropriate backups have been made, since Appliance updates cannot be undone.

## Offline Update (Deprecated)

If you possess an updater package from Auth0, use the "Update from Package" button to select the package and begin the updates.
