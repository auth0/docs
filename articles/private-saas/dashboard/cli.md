Please see your vender for instructions on generating the public access keys. Once you are in possession of the required key(s), you may associate them with your Private Saas by clicking on "Add Key". You will then be asked for the following pieces of information:

* **Name**: the name that identifies your key;
* **Key**: the public key string.

Once you have entered this information, click "Add" to persist your changes.

All of your keys are listed in a tabular format on the CLI page. If, at a later point, you would like to remove a given key from your account, you may do so by clicking on the red "X" located at the end of that key's specific row.
