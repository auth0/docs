# Auth0 Private SaaS Administration: Private SaaS Backups

If you use Auth0 Private SaaS in a stateless way (e.g. authentication, SSO), Auth0 recommends that you take **weekly** backups of all nodes using virtual machine snapshots.

If you use Auth0 Private SaaS to store data (e.g. database connections, user metadata), Auth0 recommends that you take **daily** backups of all nodes using virtual machine snapshots.
