The Appliance [exposes monitoring information](/private-saas/monitoring) in the Dashboard for common metrics (CPU/memory/etc) or through the API, which can be used by your operations team and monitoring tools to determine how the Private SaaS implementation is performing. The Appliance also includes a New Relic agent for monitoring purposes.

For Auth0 Appliance updates, we can provide you with specific addresses that are required. For certain protocols, Internet connectivity is required during operation (such as social connections or emails).
