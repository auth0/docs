# Auth0 Private SaaS: Instrumentation

The Private SaaS ships with a feature called Instrumentation, which makes it easy for your Private SaaS administrators or Auth0 Customer Success Engineers to gather information about the current (or previous) state of the Private SaaS. With Instrumentation, you are collecting time series data about the overall Private SaaS, as well as individual processes. You can then query or visualize this data to draw conclusions about the state of your Private SaaS.

> Please contact your Auth0 Customer Success Engineer if you would like to enable Instrumentation for your Private SaaS.
