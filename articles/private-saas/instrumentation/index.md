# Auth0 Appliance: Instrumentation

The Appliance ships with a feature called Instrumentation, which makes it easy for your Appliance administrators or Auth0 Customer Success Engineers to gather information about the current (or previous) state of the Appliance. With Instrumentation, you are collecting time series data about the overall Appliance, as well as individual processes. You can then query or visualize this data to draw conclusions about the state of your Appliance.

> Please contact your Auth0 Customer Success Engineer if you would like to enable Instrumentation for your Appliance.
