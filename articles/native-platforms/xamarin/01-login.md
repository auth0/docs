# Xamarin Tutorial

<<<<<<< 0c255558bddf2568970d6d0a44cea1ea775f088b
This tutorial explains how to integrate Auth0 with a Xamarin application. 

The `Xamarin.Auth0Client` helps you authenticate users with any [Auth0 supported identity provider](/identityproviders) via the OpenId Connect protocol built on top of OAuth2. The library is cross-platform, so this information can be applied to either iOS or Android.

**NOTE:** An Objective-C Binding Library for Lock iOS implementations is available at: [Lock.Xamarin](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.Xamarin).
=======
In this tutorial, we'll review how you can easily integrate Auth0 into your Xamarin app for iOS and Android. `Xamarin.Auth0Client` simplifies authenticating users within your application using any [Auth0 supported identity provider](/identityproviders). Internally, Auth0 provides this capability via the [OpenId Connect](http://openid.net/connect/) protocol, which is built atop the [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) authorization framework. Since this is a Xamarin library targetting both Android and iOS, once you've integrated it on one platform, you're all set to go on the other. 

>**Note for iOS Developers**  
If you're looking for an Objective-C binding for our Lock implementation on iOS, you can find exactly what you're looking for in its dedicated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.Xamarin).

## Tutorial

### 1. Install Xamarin.Auth0Client component

For more information, see: [How to include a Component in a Xamarin Project](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/components_walkthrough).

For more information, please visit the [Xamarin documentation page](http://docs.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/application_fundamentals/components_walkthrough).

### 2. Set up the callback URL in Auth0

Go to the [Application Settings](${uiAppSettingsURL}) section in the Auth0 dashboard and make sure that **Allowed Callback URLs** contains the following value:

`https://${account.namespace}/mobile`

### 3. Integration
<<<<<<< 0c255558bddf2568970d6d0a44cea1ea775f088b
There are three options for implementing the integration:

1. Use the [Auth0 Lock](/lock) inside a Web View - the simplest option with only a few lines of code required.
2. Create your own UI - more work, but higher control over the UI.
3. Use a specific username and password.

#### Option 1: Authentication using Lock

**Lock** is the recommended option. 

Here is a snippet of code to paste into your project:

For integration, there are a few options available to you:

+ [Using the Auth0 Login Widget inside a Web View](#integration-option-one)  
This is the simplest approach, with only a few lines of code required.  
+ [Creating your own UI](#integration-option-two)   
This requires more development effort, but offers granular control of the UI and overall user experience.  
+ [Using a specific user name and password](#integration-option-three)

To start with, we'd recommend using the __Login Widget__. To do this, simply copy and paste this code snippet of code into your project:

::: panel-info Component info
`Xamarin.Auth0Client` is built on top of the `WebRedirectAuthenticator` in the Xamarin.Auth component. All rules for standard authenticators apply regarding how the UI will be displayed.

#### Option 2: Authentication with your own UI

If you know which identity provider you want to use, you can add the `connection` parameter and the user will be directed to the specified `connection`:

<div id="integration-option-two">

#### Authentication with your own UI
</div>
If you know which identity provider you want to use, you can add a `connection` parameter and the user will be sent straight to the specified `connection`:
>>>>>>> Update 01-login.md

```cs
var user = await auth0.LoginAsync(this, "google-oauth2"); // connection name here
```

**NOTE:** Connection names can be found on Auth0 dashboard (e.g. `facebook`, `linkedin`, `saml-protocol-connection`).

#### Option 3: Authentication with a specific username and password

=======
#### Authentication with specific user name and password
<div id="integration-option-three"></div>

<div id="integration-option-three">
#### Authentication with specific user name and password
</div>
>>>>>>> Create 01-login.md
```cs
var user = await auth0.LoginAsync(
  "sql-azure-database",   	// connection name here
  "jdoe@foobar.com",      	// user name
  "1234");             		// password
```

## Access user information

The `Auth0User` contains a number of publicly accessible properties that expose information about a successfully authenticated user. These properties include:

<<<<<<< 0c255558bddf2568970d6d0a44cea1ea775f088b
* `Profile`: returns a `Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject` object from [Json.NET component](http://components.xamarin.com/view/json.net/) containing all available user attributes (e.g.:`user.Profile["email"].ToString()`).
* `IdToken`: a JSON Web Token (JWT) containing all of the user attributes and signed with your client secret.
* `Auth0AccessToken`: the `access_token` that can be used to call the Auth0 API. For example, you could use this token to [Link Accounts](/link-accounts).
