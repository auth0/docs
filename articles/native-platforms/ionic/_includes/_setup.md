## Configure Callback URLs

A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects to after the user has authenticated. You can set the Callback URL by going to the [Client Settings](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings) section of your Auth0 dashboard and make sure that **Allowed Callback URLs** contains the following value:

<pre><code>https://${account.namespace}/mobile</pre></code>

If you are testing your application locally, make sure to add your local URL as an **Allowed Callback URL** and the following as an **Allowed Origin (CORS)**:

```bash
file://\*
```

## Install the Dependencies

As stated before, the seed project contains all the required Bower dependencies and has the references added to the `index.html` file. If you would rather integrate Auth0 into an existing Ionic application instead of using our seed project, you will need to add the following Bower dependencies to your application:

```bash
bower install --save auth0-lock angular-lock angular-jwt
```

You will also need to add the references to the libraries to your application's `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Auth0 Lock -->
<script src="lib/auth0-lock/build/lock.min.js"></script>
<!-- lock-angular -->
<script src="lib/angular-lock/dist/angular-lock.min.js"></script>
<!-- angular-jwt -->
<script src="lib/angular-jwt/dist/angular-jwt.min.js"></script>
```

The purpose of each of these references are as follows:

 - **auth0-lock** is the default authentication widget provided by Auth0
 - **angular-lock**: Auth0's wrapper for using Lock with Angular
 - **angular-jwt**: Library that contains several useful services which make using JSON Web Tokens in Angular apps easy

## Add the `InAppBrowser` Plugin

You must install the `InAppBrowser` plugin from Cordova to be able to show the Login popup. The seed project already has this plugin added, but if you are adding Auth0 to your own application you need to run the following command:

```bash
ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-inappbrowser
```

and then add the following configuration to the `config.xml` file:

```xml
<feature name="InAppBrowser">
  <param name="ios-package" value="CDVInAppBrowser" />
  <param name="android-package" value="org.apache.cordova.inappbrowser.InAppBrowser" />
</feature>
```
