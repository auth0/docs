This multistep quickstart guide will walk you through setting up and managing authentication in your Ionic apps using Auth0.

::: panel-info System Requirements
These tutorials and seed projects have been tested with the following:

* Ionic 1.3.1
:::



Auth0 provides wrappers for using the [Lock widget](https://auth0.com/lock) and the [auth0.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js) library in Anguar apps, and these wrappers will be used throughout these quickstart guides.

## Samples Projects

If you want to follow along with these quickstart guides, download the [seed project](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ionic-samples/tree/master/00-Starter-Seed) as a starting point. The seed project is just a basic, blank Ionic application with all the Bower dependencies included and the required references added to the `index.html` file. You can also download the source code for each quickstart step from these docs.
