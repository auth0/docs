At some point, your APIs may need to allow limited access to users, servers, or servers on behalf of users. This tutorial demonstrates how to use the [Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/authorization-code-grant-pkce) to give your applications (or third-party applications) limited access to your APIs on behalf of users. For more information, check out [our documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth).

### Before Starting

## Enable OAuth 2.0 API Authorization

<%= include('../../_includes/_configure_oauth2aas') %>

## Create an Application

Be sure to register the URL of your app in the Allowed Callback URLs in your Client Settings.

## Create a Resource Server (API)

<%= include('../../_includes/_new_api') %>

Take note of the API Identifier and Scopes you defined in the Dashboard, as they will be used later.
