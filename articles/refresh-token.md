# Refresh Tokens

A **refresh token** is a special kind of token that can be used to obtain a renewed `id_token` ([JWT](/jwt)) at any time.
Refresh tokens must be stored securely by an application because they essentially allow a user to remain authenticated forever.

> For more information on all the types of access tokens used by Auth0, see [Tokens](/tokens).

## Introduction

The response of an [authentication request](/protocols) can result in an `id_token` (JWT) being issued by Auth0.
This token can be used to make authenticated calls to a secured API.

Among other security measures like signing, JWTs have an expiration date indicated by the `exp` claim.
However, applications that are locally installed on a device such as a desktop or smartphone might want to avoid asking the user to enter credentials each time a token expires.

A refresh token allows the application to request Auth0 to issue a new `id_token` directly, without needing to reauthenticate.
This works as long as the refresh token has not been revoked.

## Security considerations

Because a refresh token never expires, it is important to provide a way to revoke them.
This can be done manually from the dashboard or programatically through Auth0's API.

Refresh tokens can be issued and revoked for each combination of __app__, __user__ and __device__.
To revoke a __refresh token__, you can call the **[revoke refresh token](/api/v1#delete--api-users--user_id--refresh_tokens--refresh_token-)** endpoint:

```
DELETE https://${account.namespace}/api/users/<user id>/refresh_tokens/<refresh token>

{
  "Authorization":   "Bearer <your access token>",
}

```

## Obtaining a refresh token

To obtain a refresh token, the [`offline_access` scope](/scopes) and an arbitrary `device` name must be included when initiating an authentication request through the [`/authorize` endpoint](/auth-api#!#get--offline-access).
For example:

```
GET https://${account.namespace}/authorize/?
    response_type=token
    &client_id=${account.clientId}
    &redirect_uri=YOUR_CALLBACK_URL
    &state=VALUE_THAT_SURVIVES_REDIRECTS
    &scope=openid%20offline_access
    &device=my-device
```

> Note: `device` can be any value, such as a unique mobile device identifier.
Refresh tokens can be issued and revoked for each unique combination of __app__, __user__ and __device__.

When the authentication flow finishes, Auth0 will redirect the user to the callback URL as usual.
The complete URL will be as follows:

```
GET https://YOUR_CALLBACK_URL#
    access_token=2nF...WpA
    &id_token=eyJhb...
    &state=VALUE_THAT_SURVIVES_REDIRECTS
    &refresh_token=Cqp...Mwe
```

The refresh token is returned as part of the URL, in the form of an opaque string.

> In this case, the token was returned to the client directly in the URL because the [implicit flow](/protocols#oauth-for-native-clients-and-javascript-in-the-browser) was used (`response_type=token`).

## Using a refresh token

To obtain a new `id_token`, the **[delegation endpoint](/auth-api#!#post--delegation)** is used:

```
POST https://${account.namespace}/delegation
Content-Type: 'application/json'
{
  "client_id":       "${account.clientId}",
  "grant_type":      "urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer",
  "refresh_token":   "your_refresh_token",
  "api_type":        "app"
}
```

A response from this request could be as follows:

```
{
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "expires_in": 30000,
  "id_token": "eyJ..."
}
```

The `expires_in` parameter indicates the lifetime of the new JWT in seconds.
It can be calculated by the difference between the `exp` and `iat` claims of the JWT.


## SDK support

Libraries such as `auth0.js`, Lock and `auth0-angular.js` include support to obtain and use refresh tokens:

* [Getting it with Auth0.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js#login)  and [using it to get a new id_token](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js#refresh-token)
* [Getting and using it with Lock](/libraries/lock/using-a-refresh-token).
* [Getting and using it with Auth0-angular.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular/blob/master/docs/refresh-token.md)
