# Upgrade Notice: Email Delivery Changes "From" Address (Cloud Only)

| Severity | Platforms | Grace Period Start | Mandatory Opt-In|

| Medium | Auth0 Cloud Only | 2016-04-20 | 2016-04-27 |

Auth0's built-in email provider starting sending all emails from a predefined "from" address (`no-reply@auth0user.net`). Custom Email Providers will now be free for every customer, and to be able to customize the "from" address you can switch to an Auth0-supported [third-party service](/email/providers) ([Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), [Mandrill](https://www.mandrill.com/signup/), [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/pricing)) or another [SMTP-based provider](/email/custom).

If you already use a custom email provider, nothing will change.
