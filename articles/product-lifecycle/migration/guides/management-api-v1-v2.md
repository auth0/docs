# Migration Guide: Management API v1 to v2

For a complete list of breaking changes associated with this deprecation, see [Management API v2 Changes](/api/management/v2/changes).

## Check requests

Deprecation Notices will be recorded in your Tenant Logs for requests that will fail at API v1â€™s End of Life. You can search for relevant Deprecation Notices in your tenant logs with the following query: 

```
type:depnote AND description:*APIv1*
```

![Management API Version 1 Log Query](/media/articles/migrations/apiv1-log-query.png)

To help identify the Application making requests, logs will include the `client_id` used to make the request. You can also find the endpoint being used in the logs `details.path` field.

Note that our current SDKs all use Management API v2. If you're seeing API v1 activity from an Application that is leveraging an older SDK, you should upgrade to the latest version.

::: note
Auth0 generates only one log for each `client_id` and `details.path` combination every 60 minutes. No matter how many calls you make to the deprecated endpoints, you will still see a single log per hour for *each* deprecated endpoint an application calls.

If you implement changes to your requests, you'll need to allow 60 minutes to elapse before you can conclusively determine that the lack of new `depnote` logs means the deprecated endpoints have been removed from your code.

## Migration steps

After replacing all calls to the Management API v1 with their [Management API v2 replacements](/api/management/v2/changes), you should confirm you are no longer seeing Deprecation Notices in your Tenant Logs and **disable the Management API v1 for your tenant.** 

You can disable API v1 by going **Tenant Settings** > **Advanced** > **Migration** in the [Auth0 Dashboard](http://manage.auth0.com/). This will simulate the expected behavior after the End of Life date, causing calls to API v1 to fail with a `410` HTTP status code. You will be able to re-enable API v1 any time before the End of Life date.

By migrating your requests to API v2 and disabling API v1 as soon as possible, you will ensure that your systems will continue to operate uninterrupted after the **July 13th, 2020** End of Life date, at which time the option to enable API v1 will be removed.
