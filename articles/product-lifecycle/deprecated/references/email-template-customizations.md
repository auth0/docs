# Deprecation Notice: Email Template Customization (Cloud Only)

| Severity | Platforms | Grace Period Start | Mandatory Opt-In|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Medium | Auth0 Cloud Only | 2016-07-21 | 2016-08-29 |

Auth0's built-in email provider will no longer be supported for use in a production environment. The emails sent using the Auth0 provider will no longer be customizable. They will be restricted to the template and you will not be able to change the *from address* or subject line.

## Next steps

The built-in email service may still be used for test purposes but you must switch to an Auth0-supported [third-party service](/email/providers) ([Amazon SES](https://aws.amazon.com/ses/), [Mandrill](https://www.mandrill.com/signup/), [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/pricing)) or another [SMTP-based provider](/email/custom) before moving your apps to production.

If you already use a custom email provider, no action is necessary.
