## Customize Lock in the Hosted Login Page

The default login page for your tenant is a template that will use Lock to provide your users with an attractive interface and smooth authentication process, as discussed above. You can look over that template and use it as a starting point if you choose to customize it in any way.

If you want to change any of Lock's [configurable options](/libraries/lock/customization), you can do so using the [Hosted Pages](${manage_url}/#/login_page) editor interface. These options can alter the behavior of Lock itself, or the look and feel of the widget using the theming options. See the [configuration documentation](/libraries/lock/customization) for details on how to customize Lock.

When you're done making changes to the code, click **Save** to persist the changes.
