# Use the Management API in rules

You have limited access to the [Management API](/api/management/v2) inside Rules. In particular, the version of the Node.js client library available from rules only allow you to update the user's `app_metadata` and `user_metadata` as descibed in [User Metadata in Rules](/rules/current/metadata-in-rules).

## Accessing a Newer Version of the Node.js Client Library

You can load a newer version of the Auth0 Node.js client library by requiring the specific version on the library. The sample code below loads version `2.6.0` of the library, then query the list of users and log the users to the console (to be inspected with the [Real-time Webtask Logs Extension](/extensions/realtime-webtask-logs)):

```js
function (user, context, callback) {
  var ManagementClient = require('auth0@2.6.0').ManagementClient;
  var management = new ManagementClient({
    token: auth0.accessToken,
    domain: auth0.domain
  });

  management.getUsers(function (err, users) {
    console.log(users);
    callback(null, user, context);
  });
}
```

::: note
The `access_token` for the Management API which is available through `auth0.accessToken` is limited to the `read:users` and `update:users` scopes. If you require a broader range of scopes you can [request a token using Client Credentials Grant](/api/management/v2/tokens#automate-the-process).
