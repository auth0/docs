# Context Argument Properties in Rules

When creating [Rules](/rules), one of the input arguments is `context`. This is an object containing contextual information of the current authentication transaction, such as user's IP address, application, location, and so forth.

The following properties are available for the `context` object:

* `clientID`: the client id of the application the user is logging in to.
* `clientName`: the name of the application (as defined on the dashboard).
* `clientMetadata`: is an object, whose keys and values are strings, for holding other application properties.
* `connection`: the name of the connection used to authenticate the user (such as: `twitter` or `some-google-apps-domain`)
* `connectionStrategy`: the type of connection. For social connection `connectionStrategy` === `connection`. For enterprise connections, the strategy will be `waad` (Windows Azure AD), `ad` (Active Directory/LDAP), `auth0` (database connections), and so on.
* `samlConfiguration`: an object that controls the behavior of the SAML and WS-Fed endpoints. Useful for advanced claims mapping and token enrichment (only available for `samlp` and `wsfed` protocol).
* `protocol`: the authentication protocol. Possible values:
  - `oidc-basic-profile`: most used, web based login
  - `oidc-implicit-profile`: used on mobile devices and single page apps
  - `oauth2-resource-owner`: user/password login typically used on database connections
  - `oauth2-resource-owner-jwt-bearer`: login using a bearer JWT signed with user's private key
  - `oauth2-password`: login using the password exchange
  - `oauth2-refresh-token`: refreshing a token using the Refresh Token exchange
  - `samlp`: SAML protocol used on SaaS apps
  - `wsfed`: WS-Federation used on Microsoft products like Office365
  - `wstrust-usernamemixed`: WS-trust user/password login used on CRM and Office365
  - `delegation`: when calling the [Delegation endpoint](/api/authentication#delegation)
  - `redirect-callback`: when a redirect rule is resumed
* `stats`: an object containing specific user stats, like `stats.loginsCount`. Note that any of the counter variables returned as part of the `stats` object does not increase during [silent authentication](/api-auth/tutorials/silent-authentication) (as when `prompt=none`)
* `sso`: this object will contain information about the SSO transaction (if available)
  - `with_auth0`: when a user signs in with SSO to an application where the `Use Auth0 instead of the IdP to do Single Sign On` setting is enabled.
  - `with_dbconn`: an SSO login for a user that logged in through a database connection.
  - `current_clients`: client IDs using SSO.
* `accessToken`: used to add custom namespaced claims to the `access_token`.
* `idToken`: used to add custom namespaced claims to the `id_token`.
* `sessionID`: unique id for the authentication session. Value is kept only if `prompt=none`
* `request`: an object containing useful information of the request. It has the following properties:
  - `userAgent`: the user-agent of the application that is trying to log in.
  - `ip`: the originating IP address of the user trying to log in.
  - `hostname`: the hostname that is being used for the authentication flow.
  - `query`: an object containing the querystring properties of the login transaction sent by the application. 
  - `body`: the body of the POST request on login transactions used on `oauth2-resource-owner`, `oauth2-resource-owner-jwt-bearer` or `wstrust-usernamemixed` protocols.
  - `geoip`: an object containing geographic IP information. It has the following properties:
    - `country_code`: a two-character code for the country associated with the IP address
    - `country_code3`: a three-character code for the country associated with the IP address
    - `country_name`: the country name associated with the IP address
    - `city_name`: the city or town name associated with the IP address
    - `latitude`: the latitude associated with the IP address.
    - `longitude`: the longitude associated with the IP address.
    - `time_zone`: the timezone associated with the IP address.
    - `continent_code`: a two-character code for the continent associated with the IP address.
