# Post Change Password Hook

The Post Change Password Hook allows custom actions to be executed after a successful user password change; when a user updates their password or after a tenant administrator updates a user's password. This hook executes asynchronously with the rest of the Auth0 pipeline and its outcome does not affect the Auth0 transaction.

With the Post Change Password Hook, you can do things like:

* Send an email to a user letting them know their password has been changed.
* Logout a user so they have to login with their new password.

The Post Change Password Hook is only available for [Database Connections](/connections/database).

You can create a new Post Change Password hook using the [Dashboard](/hooks/guides/create-hooks-using-dashboard) or the [Command Line Interface](/hooks/guides/create-hooks-using-cli).

## Starter code and parameters

After you've created a new Post Change Password Hook, open up the Hook and edit it using the Webtask Editor embedded in the Dashboard. 

The parameters listed in the comment at the top of the code indicate the Auth0 objects and their parameters that can be passed into and used by the Hook's function.

```js
/**
@param {object} user - The affected user
@param {string} user.id - user id
@param {string} user.username - user name
@param {string} user.email - email
@param {string} user.last_password_reset - exact date/time the user's password was changed
@param {object} context - Auth0 connection and other context info
@param {object} context.connection - information about the Auth0 connection
@param {object} context.connection.id - connection id
@param {object} context.connection.name - connection name
@param {object} context.connection.tenant - connection tenant
@param {object} context.webtask - webtask context
@param {function} cb - function (error, response)
**/
module.exports = function (user, context, cb) {
// Perform any asynchronous actions, e.g. send notification to Slack.
cb();
};
```

The callback function `cb` at the end of the sample code is used to signal completion and must not be omitted.

### Response

The Post Change Password Hook ignores any response object.

## Testing Hooks

::: note
Executing the code using the Runner requires a save, which means that the original code will be overwritten.
:::

Once you've modified the sample code, you can test Hooks using the Runner. The runner simulates a call to the Hook with the appropriate user information body/payload. The following is the sample body that populates the Runner by default (these are the same objects/parameters detailed in the comment at the top of the sample Hook code):

```json
{
  "user": {
    "tenant": "my-tenant",
    "username": "user1",
    "email": "user1@foo.com",
    "emailVerified": true,
    "phoneNumber": "1-000-000-0000",
    "phoneNumberVerified": true,
    "user_metadata": {
      "hobby": "surfing"
    },
    "app_metadata": {
      "plan": "full"
    }
  },
  "context": {
    "requestLanguage": "en-us",
    "connection": {
      "id": "con_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
      "name": "Username-Password-Authentication",
      "tenant": "my-tenant"
    }
  }
}
```

## Example: Use SendGrid to send a password change notification email

```js
module.exports = function (user, context, cb) {

  const request = require('request');

  // https://sendgrid.api-docs.io/v3.0/mail-send
  request.post({
    url: 'https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': 'Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
    },
    json: {
      personalizations: [{
        to: [{
          email: user.email
        }]
      }],
      from: {
        email: 'admin@example.com'
      },
      subject: 'Your password was changed',
      content: [{
        type: 'text/plain',
        value: 'The password for your ' + context.connection.name + ' account ' + user.email + ' was recently changed.'
      }]
    }
  }, function (err, resp, body) {
    if (err || resp.statusCode !== 202) {
      return cb(err || new Error(body.message));
    }

    cb();
  });
};
```
