# Overview

Hooks allow you to extend the Auth0 platform with custom code.

Hooks are Webtasks associated with specific extensibility points of the Auth0 platform. When using [Database Connections](/connections/database), Auth0 invokes the Hooks at runtime to execute your custom logic.

You can manage your Hooks using:

* [The Auth0 Management Dashboard](/hooks/dashboard)
* [The Auth0 Command-Line Interface (CLI)](/hooks/cli).

## Supported Extensibility Points

You can create Hooks for the following [extensibility points](/hooks/extensibility-points):

- [Credentials Exchange](/hooks/extensibility-points/credentials-exchange)
- [Pre-User Registration](/hooks/extensibility-points/pre-user-registration)
- [Post-User Registration](/hooks/extensibility-points/post-user-registration)
