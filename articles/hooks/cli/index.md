# Work with Hooks using the CLI

The Auth0 Command-Line Interface (CLI) allows you to create, edit, enable/disable, and delete Hooks associated with specific extensibility points within the Auth0 platform. You can also use the CLI to identify Hooks and gather real-time logging information.

## Set Up the CLI

You can find instructions for installing and configuring the Webtask CLI in the [Dashboard > Webtask page](${manage_url}/#/account/webtasks). 

The `wt-cli` package also includes the `auth0` binary, allowing you to use the Auth0 CLI.

## Work with Hooks

Once you have installed and set up the CLI, you can use it to create new Hooks and manage/delete existing Hooks. You can also use it to gather real-time log data on your Hooks.

::: note
The Auth0 CLI examples use `auth0-profile` as the name of the profile. This is the same profile name used when installing `wt-cli`, and you can obtain it from *Step 2* of the instructions set located on [Dashboard > Webtask](${manage_url}/#/account/webtasks).
