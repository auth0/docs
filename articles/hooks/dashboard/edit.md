# Edit Existing Hooks Using the Dashboard

You can edit the code for your existing Hook using the [Webtask Editor](https://webtask.io/docs/editor). To open up the Webtask Editor:

1. Navigate to [the Hooks page of the Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/hooks) and find the Hook you want to edit.
2. Click the **Pencil and Paper** icon to the right of the Hook to open the Webtask Editor.

## Test Your Hook

The Webtask Editor allows you to test your Hook using the Runner. By default, the Runner is hidden until you choose to display it by clicking its icon in the top left of the Editor.

The Runner allows you to simulate an Auth0 call to your Hook and provides the basic parameters needed to complete the call. You can edit the provided schema as necessary.

When you're ready, click **Run** to proceed. You will be presented with the results of the call.

If you run multiple tests, the Runner keeps track of the calls you've made in its *History* section. For each result, you can see specific details about the call by clicking **>** to the right of the call result.

:::panel Test Runner Schema
If you created your Hook early on during the beta testing period, your Webtask Editor/Test Runner window might not populate with the schema required to successfully use the Test Runner. If that is the case, you'll need to save the Hook's code, delete the Hook, and create a new Hook using your existing code.

## Rename Your Hook

You can rename your Hook using the Management Dashboard.

1. In [the Hooks page of the Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/hooks), find the Hook you want to edit.
2. Click the **Gear** icon next to your Hook.
3. Click **Rename**. You will see a dialog pop up, asking you for the **Current Name** of the Hook, as well as the **New Name** you want to use. Click **Rename** when you have populated both values.
