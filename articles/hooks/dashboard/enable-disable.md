# Enable or Disable Hooks

You can use the Management Dashboard to enable/disable Hooks. Each extensibility point may be associated with **zero** or **one** active Hook.

::: note
When creating new Hooks, Auth0 enables your Hook for that extensibility point if there are no other Hooks associated with that point. In any other circumstance, Auth0 does *not* enable your new Hook.
:::

## Enable a Hook

1. Navigate to [the Hooks page of the Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/hooks) and find the extensibility point for which you want an enabled Hook.
2. Immediately under the name and description of the extensibility point, click on the dropdown box that lists all of the point's associated Hooks.
