# Extensibility Points for Hooks

Hooks allow you to customize the behavior of Auth0 with Node.js code, but they are executed only against selected extensibility points, which are the serverless option analogous to the webhooks that come with a server. The following is a list of currently available extensibility points:

- [Credentials Exchange](/hooks/concepts/credentials-exchange-extensibility-point): Change the scopes and add custom claims to the tokens issued by the Auth0 API's `POST /oauth/token` endpoint.
- [Pre-User Registration](/hooks/concepts/pre-user-registration-extensibility-point): Prevent user registration and add custom metadata to a newly-created user.
- [Post-User Registration](/hooks/concepts/post-user-registration-extensibility-point): Implement custom actions that execute asynchronously from the Auth0 authentication process after a new user registers and is added to the database.
