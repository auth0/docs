# Credentials Exchange Extensibility Point

The `credentials-exchange` extensibility point allows you to change the scopes and add custom claims to the [Access Tokens](/tokens/overview-access-tokens) issued by the [Auth0 API's `POST /oauth/token` endpoint](/api/authentication#authorization-code) during runtime.

::: note
Please see [Client Credentials Flow](/flows/concepts/client-credentials) for more information on the Client Credentials Grant.
:::

## Claim types

You can add the following as claims to the issued token:

* The `scope` property of the response object;
* Any properties with namespaced property names:

  * URLs with HTTP or HTTPS schemes
  * URLs with hostnames that *aren't* auth0.com, webtask.io, webtask.run, or the associated subdomain names

The extensibility point will ignore all other response object properties.

::: note
If you need to configure client secrets and access them within Hooks, use `context.webtask.secrets.SECRET_NAME`.
