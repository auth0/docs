# Implementation Checklists

Auth0 recommends that you break your implementation into six phases to plan and complete your implementation. 

* [Analyze](#analyze)
* [Design](#design)
* [Build](#build)
* [Test](#test)
* [Deploy](#deploy) 
* [Monitor](#monitor)

Auth0 provides a checklist (Google Sheets format) for each phase with links to pertinent Auth0 documentation. Not all parts of each phase may apply to you. 

## How to use the checklists

1. Right-click the links below to open each checklist in a new tab.
2. Save a copy or export them to another spreadsheet application.
3. Customize the checklists to suit your needs. 

## Analyze
[Analyze Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hTtRvvO6Szlvcr4XnsgzzmJj7FmmucAZAmFF275hB20/edit?usp=sharing)

In the Analyze phase, analyze end-user business requirements and determine project goals as part of the high-level plan for the project. Convert the requirements and goals into system functions that the organization intends to develop. Activities include:

* Gathering business requirements
* Creating process diagrams
* Performing detailed analysis
* Alignment to project plan

## Design
[Design Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L0PLqcghVvCSdW_OmLoKlU0uDJtb5mw6uIufMrKW7ro/edit?usp=sharing) 

In the Design phase, describe the desired features and operations of the system, including  business rules, pseudo-code, screen layouts, and other necessary documentation. Activities include:

* Infrastructure design
* System model design

## Build
[Build Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wd5HwONEi2Max7zcORJpwn8yQO_mbu62FDc-Sk8oWS8/edit?usp=sharing)

In the Build phase, develop the actual system through implementation of infrastructure and code. Activities include:

* Infrastructure implementation
* Code implementation

## Test
[Test Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19tQOQ_heBVpHXx-YKZZY20u6y8mU8IwRHEF32znZ_-w/edit?usp=sharing)

In the Test phase, integrate and deploy all implemented code in the testing environment infrastructure. Testing then follows Software Testing Life Cycle activities to check the system for errors, bugs, and defects to verify that system features work as expected (or not). Activities include:

* Write test cases
* Execute test cases

## Deploy
[Deploy Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MRBz4CiT6RTL7Mf7eWmpjSZEQS3rwjNryyPGmvjn-fc/edit?usp=sharing) 

In the Deploy phase, deploy the system to either a staging or production environment, where actual users begin to operate and interact with it. 

Eventually, you deploy all components of the system to the production environment when you make a live release.

## Monitor
[Monitor Checklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zHs29OoeiludHxY5cV06oGVAIW91jMjUflJgzJVaRKo/edit?usp=sharing)

In the Monitor phase, make enhancements, corrections, and changes to ensure the system continues to work and stays updated to meet the business objectives and support the needs of the users. Activities include: 

* Monitoring
* Maintenance
* Changes and adjustments
* Upgrade and adapt to future needs
