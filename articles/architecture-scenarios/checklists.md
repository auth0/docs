# Implementation Planning Checklists

Click the links below to download a checklist that corresponds to a phase in the SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle). You can open the checklist in any spreadsheet application and customize them to suit your needs.

In the Analyze phase, analyze end-user business requirements and determine project goals as part of the high-level plan for the project. Convert the requirements and goals into system functions that the organization intends to develop. Activities include:

* Gathering business requirements
* Creating process diagrams
* Performing detailed analysis
* Alignment to project plan

In the Design phase, describe the desired features and operations of the system, including business rules, pseudo-code, screen layouts, and other necessary documentation. Activities include:

* Infrastructure design
* System model design

## <span data-trackOutbound>![](/media/articles/architecture-scenarios/checklists/file_type_icons-02.png) [Build Checklist](/media/articles/architecture-scenarios/checklists/Build-Checklist.xlsx) </span>

In the Build phase, develop the actual system through implementation of infrastructure and code. Activities include:

* Infrastructure implementation
* Code implementation

## <span data-trackOutbound>![](/media/articles/architecture-scenarios/checklists/file_type_icons-02.png) [Test Checklist](/media/articles/architecture-scenarios/checklists/Test-Checklist.xlsx) </span>

In the Test phase, integrate and deploy all implemented code in the testing environment infrastructure. Testing then follows Software Testing Life Cycle activities to check the system for errors, bugs, and defects to verify that system features work as expected (or not). Activities include:

* Write test cases
* Execute test cases

## <span data-trackOutbound>![](/media/articles/architecture-scenarios/checklists/file_type_icons-02.png) [Deploy Checklist](/media/articles/architecture-scenarios/checklists/Deploy-Checklist.xlsx) </span>

In the Deploy phase, deploy the system to either a staging or production environment, where actual users begin to operate and interact with it. 

Eventually, you deploy all components of the system to the production environment when you make a live release.

## <span data-trackOutbound>![](/media/articles/architecture-scenarios/checklists/file_type_icons-02.png) [Monitor Checklist](/media/articles/architecture-scenarios/checklists/Monitor-Checklist.xlsx) </span>

In the Monitor phase, make enhancements, corrections, and changes to ensure the system continues to work and stays updated to meet the business objectives and support the needs of the users. Activities include: 

* Monitoring
* Maintenance
* Changes and adjustments
* Upgrade and adapt to future needs
