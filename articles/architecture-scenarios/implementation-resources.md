# Implementation Resources

Auth0 provides a wealth of resources to help you effectively engage with our product and community. This list provides links to the resources available, by category.  

## Get started

Resources designed to help you learn the basics of Auth0 include:

* [**Getting Started documentation**](/getting-started): Explore the Auth0 Dashboard and common terms used for components of the Auth0 service. Gain a broad understanding of Auth0 and learn the terminology you might hear when working with Auth0 staff or reading our docs.

* [**Get Started with Auth0 Video Series**](/videos/get-started): In these short videos, we cover how easy it is to complete the basic steps to use Auth0 with your applications. Watch the series before you start your project so you can get the benefit of our knowledge and experience with other customers. We cover tenant configuration, provisioning user stores and importing users, authentication, authorization, and branding and customization of everything shown to your users. 

* [**Architecture scenarios**](/architecture-scenarios): Review common architecture scenarios and learn how to implement them with Auth0. Scenarios include tutorials for common architecture patterns, such as a Single-Page Application (SPA) calling an API. High-level descriptions are useful for architects, while tutorials will help development teams.

* [**Implementation guides**](/topics/guides): Learn how to implement commonly-used features, such as user management and multi-factor authentication (MFA). This information is useful for both architects and developers.

* [**How to have a successful IDM Project blog post**](https://auth0.com/blog/how-to-have-a-successful-idm-project/): Learn how to create a realistic project plan that will ensure a satisfying Identity Management project deployment.

## Learn

Auth0 provides numerous tutorials, guides, white papers, and blog posts that focus on both learning and providing quick reference checks. 

* [**Docs site**](https://auth0.com/docs/): Browse through our docs to explore a wealth of available topics, or use our search to quickly find content related to a topic or term.

* [**Feature descriptions and white papers**](https://auth0.com/learn/): Investigate short descriptions of features, industry case studies, and reference white papers. The Auth0 Learn site provides a quick overview of Auth0 features and their business value; it is helpful for project owners as well as architects and developers.

* [**Blog posts**](https://auth0.com/blog/): Read blog posts written by experts on a variety of topics--from time-honored advice to breaking news in the identity space. Many blog posts are oriented toward architects and developers. 

## Run sample code

Once your development team is ready to build, Auth0 provides sample programs, SDKs, and libraries to speed your project along.

* [**Quickstarts**](/quickstarts): Investigate a rich array of small sample programs that demonstrate how to implement the key features you’ll want to include in your program, such as authentication, session management, profile updates, and logout. Quickstarts will give developers a head start on understanding how to integrate applications with Auth0.

* [**Libraries and SDKs**](/libraries): Simplify your custom application development by using our extensive set of libraries and SDKs, which abstract many of the details of identity protocols for you. Auth0 SDKs support numerous languages and frameworks to simplify your integration with Auth0. We also provide a library for Lock, a login widget, that you can use across several platforms, including iOS and Android.

* [**Management API**](/api/management/v2): Explore and manipulate objects, configurations, and settings within Auth0. The Management API Explorer allows you to quickly manipulate individual objects and settings on an *ad-hoc* basis and test API calls before coding them into your applications.

* [**Authentication API**](/api/authentication): Authenticate and authorize users via the OIDC, OAuth, and <dfn data-key="security-assertion-markup-language">SAML</dfn> protocols. The Authentication API Explorer allows you to experiment with authentication and authorization flows, and test API calls before coding them into your applications.

## Try out features and API calls

While building, Auth0 allows you to experiment with and test out various product features.

* **TRY buttons/links**: Quickly try out Auth0 product features. **TRY** buttons are located throughout Auth0 and allow you to experiment with connections, rules, hooks, and email templates.

* [**Authentication API Explorer**](/api/authentication#introduction): Experiment with authentication and authorization flows, and test API calls before coding them into your applications. 

* [**Management API Explorer**](/api/management/v2): Quickly manipulate individual objects and settings on an *ad-hoc* basis and test API calls before coding them into your applications.

* [**Postman Collections**](/api/postman): Easily dissect our APIs' calls using Postman by importing our Postman Collections.

## Get help

Auth0 resources that help you troubleshoot your implementation include:

* [**Auth0 Community forum**](https://community.auth0.com/): Connect with the world of Auth0 via Auth0 posts, FAQs, and community Q&As. Architects and developers find this a valuable source of information for learning and connecting with others as well as getting help on issues.

* [**Support Center**](https://support.auth0.com/): View and manage your subscription and tenants, file and view support requests, run automated production checks on a tenant, and view compliance information. Paid subscribers will find the support center a valuable resource if an issue or question cannot be solved by documentation or by searching the forum.

  * [**Create support cases**](/support/tickets): Create and file a support case if you need help.
  
  * [**Support Plans and Service Level Agreements**](/support#defect-responses): Learn about multiple levels of support available for purchase.

  * [**Troubleshooting tips**](/onboarding/enterprise-support#what-to-check-before-logging-an-issue) and [**Information to include in your support case**](/onboarding/enterprise-support#information-to-provide-when-logging-an-issue): Get advice to help your development and support teams analyze issues.

* [**Supported versions**](/support/matrix): Understand which versions of SDKs, browsers, and languages are supported. Architects and developers should review this to ensure your project employs languages, libraries, and SDKs that will allow your implementation to work with Auth0.

* [**Feedback Portal**](https://auth0.com/feedback): Make product suggestions. (You can also do this via the Support Center if you want better visibility into what you’ve filed over time.) Architects and developers can use this site to provide feedback on the Auth0 product for consideration as enhancements in the future.

* [**Professional Services**](/services): Engage our world-wide professional services team to help speed your project to success. Project owners will find this useful for learning how Auth0 identity experts can help accelerate your project or fill in any temporary skill gaps.

## Setup and monitor operations

When you're ready to plan your launch, Auth0 provides the following resources:

* [**Pre-launch advice**](/pre-deployment) and [**Production check**](/pre-deployment/how-to-run-test): Get tips and tools to help you plan your launch. Project managers and development and operations teams should explore these tips to leverage advice for a smooth launch.

* [**Operational policies**](/policies): Familiarize yourself with Auth0's policies, so you know lead times for operational requests. Policies are useful for an entire team, but project owners and operations teams in particular should be aware of Auth0's operational policies.

* [**Status Dashboard**](https://status.auth0.com): Quickly determine the availability of Auth0 services and subscribe to status updates. Although service interruptions are rare, when one occurs Auth0 conducts a root cause analysis and publishes the results on this site. Operations and support teams should be familiar with how to check Auth0 status.

* [**Monitor endpoints**](/monitoring): Learn how to integrate our monitoring endpoints into your monitoring infrastructure. This information is of particular use to operations teams and project owners.

* [**Log data**](/logs): Learn about the types of logs Auth0 provides, log data retention, and tools you can use to export log data to external analytical tools for analysis and long-term data storage. This information is useful for developers and operations teams, as well as compliance teams interested in data retention.

* [**Dashboard notices**](/architecture-scenarios/implementation/b2c/b2c-operations#notifications): Stay informed about important announcements from Auth0. From time to time, Auth0 notifies you of important information via your Auth0 Dashboard and (depending on the severity of the information) via email to your registered Auth0 Dashboard Admins.
