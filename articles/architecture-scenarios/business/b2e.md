# Business to Enterprise Identity Scenarios

::: note
This architecture scenario is under construction and will be updated soon.

In this scenario you have a large organization who wants to federate their existing enterprise directory service to allow employees to log in to the various internal, as well as 3rd party applications, using their existing enterprise credentials.

The 3rd party applications will typically be configured to use SAML as a protocol to communicate with Auth0, whereas the internal applications will more typically use OpenID Connect to communicate with Auth0.

Since there are usually multiple configured applications, SSO (single sign-on) is important. Often times some sort of dashboard UI is used to host shortcuts to all the applications that a given user has access to. In that case, users typically first log into the dashboard and then jump to the various applications they wish to use, and each jump uses SSO to facilitate automatic login.
