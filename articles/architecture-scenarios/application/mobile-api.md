# Mobile + API

::: note
This architecture scenario is under construction and will be updated soon.

![Mobile + API Flow](/media/articles/architecture-scenarios/mobile-api.png)

In this scenario you have a mobile application ("Client") which talks to an API ("Resource Server"). The application will use **OpenID Connect** with the **Authorization Code Grant using Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** to authenticate users. Note that this flow can only be used for Clients whose type is **Native** in the [Dashboard](${manage_url}).

When a user logs in, Auth0 will return to the application an `access_token`, an `id_token`, and optionally a `refresh_token`:

- The `access_token` is used to securely call the API on behalf of the user.

- The `id_token` is consumed only by the client and contains user profile data. Alternatively the user profile can be obtained by calling the `/userinfo` endpoint in the Auth0 Authentication API with the `access_token` (provided that the API for which the `access_token` is issued, uses `RS256` as signing algorithm).

- The `refresh_token` can be used in order to obtain a new `access_token` whenever a previous one expires. Note that a `refresh_token` will only be present in the response if you included the `offline_access` scope and enabled **Allow Offline Access** for your API in the [Dashboard](${manage_url}).

The application will usually store the information about the user's session (i.e. whether they are logged in, their tokens, user profile data, and so forth) inside some sort of Local Storage on the mobile device.
