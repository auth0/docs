# SPA + API

![SPA + API Flow](/media/articles/architecture-scenarios/spa-api.png)

In this scenario you have a Single Page Web Application ("Client") which talks to an API ("Resource Server"). The application will use **OpenID Connect** with the **Implicit Grant Flow** to authenticate users with Auth0. Note that this flow can only be used for Clients whose type is **Single Page Application** in the [Dashboard](${manage_url}).

When a user logs in, Auth0 will return to the application an `access_token` and an `id_token`. In case the `response_type` value used is `id_token` then only an `id_token` will be returned.

- The `access_token` is used to securely call the API on behalf of the user.

- The `id_token` is consumed only by the client and contains user profile data. Alternatively the user profile can be obtained by calling the `/userinfo` endpoint in the Auth0 Authentication API with the `access_token`. In order for this to work `openid` should be granted as a scope.

The application will usually store the information about the user's session (i.e. whether they are logged in, their tokens, user profile data, and so forth) inside some sort of storage such a Local Storage.
