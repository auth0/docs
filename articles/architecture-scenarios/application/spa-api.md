# SPA + API

![Diagram for SPA + API scenario](/media/articles/architecture-scenarios/spa-api.png)

In this scenario you have a Single Page Web Application ("Client") which talks to an API ("Resource Server"). The application will use OpenID Connect with the Implicit Grant Flow to authenticate users with Auth0.

When a user logs in, Auth0 will return to the application an `access_token` as well as an `id_token`. The `access_token` is used to securely call the API on behalf of the user, while the `id_token` contains user profile attributes represented (like the user's name, email, and so forth) in the form of _claims_. Alternatively the user profile can be obtained by calling the `/userinfo` endpoint in the Auth0 Authentication API with the `access_token`.

The application will usually store the information about the user's session (i.e. whether they are logged in, their tokens, user profile data, etc) inside some sort of storage such a Local Storage.
