# Architecture Scenarios

This page describes the typical architecture scenarios we have identified when working with customers on implementing Auth0. 

The first set, called Business Scenarios, describes the architecture depending on the type of businesses, whether that be B2C (Business to Consumer applications), B2B (Business to Business applications), B2E (Enterprise applications), or a combination of B2B and B2E.

The second set, called Application Configurations, describes the typical application implementation patterns.
