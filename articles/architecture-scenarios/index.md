# Architecture Scenarios

This page describes the typical architecture scenarios we have identified when working with customers on implementing Auth0.

## Application Configurations

These scenarios describe the different type of technology architectures your application may use, and how Auth0 can help for each of those. Each scenario comes with:

* A sample business case
* The goals and requirements that the implementation must meet
* Detailed explanations of the architectural solutions
* A sample implementation

The goal of these scenarios is to walk you through the implementation process from beginning to end.

</ul>

## Under Construction

These scenarios are under construction and will soon be updated. Some describe the different type of technology architectures your application may use, while others describe the architecture depending on the type of businesses (B2C, B2B, B2E), and how Auth0 can help in each of these scenarios.
