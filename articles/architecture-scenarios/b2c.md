# Business to Consumer Identity and Access Management

This guide focuses on how to integrate Auth0 within a Consumer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) project. Auth0's recommendations are based on real-world customer implementation experience, and by following the guidance provided you will set up your project for success.

Customers using Auth0 for consumer-focused, also known as Business-to-Consumer (B2C), projects typically share a common set of goals and objectives, and in the sections that follow we'll focus on our experiences working with this shared set of expectations to help you deliver your solution efficiently.

::: note
The information provided is relevant to **all** project stakeholders. We recommend reading through this guidance in its entirety at least once, even if you've already started your journey with Auth0.

Throught this guide, Auth0 provides recommendations and best practice suggestions, and any time you come across a panel similar to the one above, or below, you should stop and consider the advice presented. These provide you with a set of high-level guidance and considerations, presented in an *ad hoc* way.

## Ways to integrate Auth0 and how to choose

There are many different ways Auth0 can be integrated into the CIAM project architecture. Auth0's flexibility comprehensively supports many different use cases, however keep in mind that not every project requires 100% of the capabilities provided by Auth0.

When you embark on your journey to integrate with Auth0, there are many things for you to consider. Knowing what, when, and how best to implement something will help you focus on completing the necessary tasks at the right time. To help you with this, we've put together some [planning guidance](https://drive.google.com/a/auth0.com/file/d/1lQU-uPTfwEi58WJMKL2azUhZhvy9h1IU/view?usp=sharing) that details our recommended strategies.

## Implementation checklists

Auth0 also provides helpful implementation planning [checklists](/architecture-scenarios/checklists) that you can use to organize your implementation tasks. Though all of these may not apply to you, there are six checklists, each of which is provided in Google Sheets format and aligns with a particular phase of a typical SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)
