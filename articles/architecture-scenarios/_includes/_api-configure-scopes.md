### Configure the Scopes

Once the application has been created you will need to configure the Scopes which applications can request during authorization.

In the settings for your API, go to the **Scopes** tab. In this section you can add all four of the scopes which were discussed before, namely `read:timesheets`, `create:timesheets`, `delete:timesheets`, `approve:timesheets`.
