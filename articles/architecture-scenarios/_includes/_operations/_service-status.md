The Auth0 [status dashboard](https://status.auth0.com/) together with the Auth0 [uptime dashboard](http://uptime.auth0.com/) shows current and past status of the Auth0 service in a human-readable format. If any monitoring alerts are triggered, and as a first step in troubleshooting, your operations staff should check the status dashboard to see if there is a current outage. The public cloud status page also provides a facility for subscribing to outage notifications, and we also recommend that you check the status of any 3rd party, [external services](/monitoring/guides/check-external-services) you depend on - such as Social Providers. Having this information handy can help quickly eliminate possible causes when troubleshooting an issue and should be at the top of a troubleshooting checklist for developers as well as the helpdesk staff.

Information on how to check the status of Auth0 as well as any dependent services (such as Social Providers) should be at the top of a troubleshooting checklist for both developers and helpdesk staff, and we recommend you subscribe via the Auth0 status page to set up notification of any status updates.

In the event of an outage to the public cloud service, Auth0 performs a Root Cause Analysis (RCA) and publishes the results on the [Auth0 status page](/support#auth0-status). Auth0 performs a thorough investigation after an outage--including a determination of root cause, as well as contributing factors and how to prevent the issue from occurring again--and as a result, an RCA document can take a few weeks to be published.
