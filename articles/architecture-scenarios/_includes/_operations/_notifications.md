There are several different types of notifications from Auth0 that you should watch for as they contain important information that could impact your tenant(s) and project.

::: note
Proactive security notifications and other operational announcements are sent by Auth0 to dashboard administrators. You should ensure that the people who need to receive such messages are dashboard administrators.

### Dashboard notifications

From time to time, Auth0 may send an important announcement related to your tenant. These announcements about your service will be sent to your Auth0 dashboard and depending on the severity of the announcement, via email to the registered Auth0 dashboard administrators. You should make a regular practice of logging in to the dashboard and checking the bell icon at the top for any important notices. In addition, you should review emails from Auth0 in a timely fashion as they may convey important information about changes or actions you need to take.

### Auth0 security bulletins

Auth0 regularly conducts a number of security-related tests, and if any issues are found, will proactively identify and notify customers who need to make security-related changes. Due to the extensible nature of the Auth0 product, however, it may not be possible for Auth0 to identify every impacted customer, so you should regularly check Auth0 [security bulletins](/security/bulletins). You should make sure a security contact for your organization is listed in Support Center.

::: panel Best Practice
It is a best practice to check the Auth0 [Security Bulletins](/security/bulletins) page periodically and take the recommended action if you are impacted by any security bulletins.

### Change log

Auth0 provides information on changes to the service in the Auth0 [change log](https://auth0.com/changelog). You should make a regular practice of reviewing Auth0 change logs to be aware of changes. Support teams researching an issue may find it useful to review the change log to determine if recent changes might be related, especially if these are [breaking changes](docs/migrations). Development teams will also want to review the change logs to identify new features that may be beneficial.
