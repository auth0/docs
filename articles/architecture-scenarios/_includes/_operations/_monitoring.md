You should establish mechanisms for [monitoring Auth0 implementations](/monitoring), so your support or operations team receives the timely information needed to proactively handle service outages. Auth0 provides monitoring endpoints that can be incorporated into your monitoring infrastructure. These endpoints are designed to provide a response suitable for consumption by monitoring services. It should be noted that they only provide data on Auth0. For complete end-to-end monitoring, which is essential for checking the ability of users to log in, we recommend that you set up synthetic transaction monitoring. This will provide greater granularity for your monitoring and enable you to detect outages unrelated to Auth0 as well as degradation of performance, so you can respond more proactively.

::: panel Best Practice
You should set up the ability to send synthetic login transactions to facilitate end-to-end monitoring of authentication. You can do this with a simple application that uses the [Resource Owner Password Grant](/api-auth/tutorials/password-grant) in combination with a test user that has no privileges, and donâ€™t forget about [Auth0 rate limiting policies](/policies/rate-limits) too.
