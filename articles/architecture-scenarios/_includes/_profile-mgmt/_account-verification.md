Youâ€™ll also want to make sure that you are working with a verified user account at all times, and make use of the mechanisms Auth0 provides. You should also consider regulatory compliance like [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/), which has some very specific requirements when it comes to protecting all EU citizens from privacy and data breaches and guidance.  

Auth0 provides out-of-box functionality for sending a [verification email](/email/custom#verification-email) to a user's email address as one way of verifying their account. By default, Auth0 is configured to automatically send verification emails for any [Database Connection](/connections/database) identity created (e.g., as part of [self sign-up](/architecture-scenarios/implementation/${platform}/${platform}-provisioning#self-sign-up)). However, Auth0 also provides a [Management API endpoint](/api/v2#!/Tickets/post_email_verification) that can also be used to send verification emails (e.g., in cases where email address validation is not performed by a Social Provider upon user registration).
