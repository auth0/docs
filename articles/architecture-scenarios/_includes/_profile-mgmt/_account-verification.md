Youâ€™ll also need to work with a verified user account at all times and make use of the mechanisms Auth0 provides. You should also consider regulatory compliance like [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/) which has very specific requirements for protecting EU citizens from privacy and data breaches.  

Auth0 provides out-of-box functionality for sending a [verification email](/email/custom#verification-email) to a user's email address to verify their account. By default, Auth0 automatically sends verification emails for any [Database Connection](/connections/database) identity created as part of [self sign-up](/architecture-scenarios/implementation/${platform}/${platform}-provisioning#self-sign-up). However, Auth0 also provides a [Management API endpoint](/api/v2#!/Tickets/post_email_verification) that you can use to send verification emails in cases where email address validation is not performed by a Social Provider upon user registration.
