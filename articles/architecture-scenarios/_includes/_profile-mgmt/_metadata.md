In addition to the Normalized User Profile information, [Metadata](/users/concepts/overview-user-metadata) can be stored in an Auth0 user profile. Metadata provides a way to store information that did not originate from an identity provider, or a way to store information that overrides what an identity provider supplies. 

::: panel Best Practice
Use of Metadata should follow Auth0 [user data storage best practices](/best-practices/user-data-storage-best-practices#metadata). Metadata storage is not designed to be a general purpose data store, and you should still use your own external storage facility when possible. Metadata size and complexity should also be kept to a minimum, and the Auth0 Management API has a strict set of guidance when it comes to updating and/or deleting metadata associated with a user.
:::

You can manipulate metadata via both the Auth0 Management API and the Auth0 Authentication API. See [Manage User Metadata](/users/guides/manage-user-metadata) for more information. As is the case when managing the Normalized User Profile, calls to the Management API for manipulating Metadata requires use of an [Access Token](api/management/v2/tokens).

### User metadata

User metadata (also referred to as `user_metadata`) is information that can be stored against a user profile and that a user can read and update as part of any self-service profile management. Metadata of this nature may be something like salutation for a user, or a userâ€™s preferred language which could be used to [customize the emails](/email/templates#common-variables) sent by Auth0.

::: panel Best Practice
Store any information that you want use to customize Auth0 emails in metadata and preferably `user_metadata` if the user is allowed to change it, such as information used to determine the language for an email.

### App metadata

App metadata (also referred to as `app_metadata`) is, on the other hand, information that can be stored with a user profile but can **only be read or updated with appropriate authorization**; `app_metadata` is not directly accessible to a user. This type of metadata could be something like a flag to indicate that the last set of valid terms and conditions was accepted by the user, and a date to indicate when the user accepted them.
