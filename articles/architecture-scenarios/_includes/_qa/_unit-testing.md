The objective of unit testing is to test individual units of code. If you create custom code within Auth0 in the form of Rules, Hooks, and/or Custom DB scripts, you should consider use a testing framework (such as [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)) to test your code. Companies who have been most successful with Auth0 have found it useful to execute these unit tests prior to [automatically deploying](/architecture-scenarios/implementation/${platform}/${platform}-deployment) Auth0 tenant configuration and collateral.
