Quality Assurance is important in identifying issues before they impact your customers and, depending on the nature of your project, there are several different types of quality assurance testing that youâ€™re going to want to consider as part of your integration with Auth0:

* Is my application easy to understand and use, even by those with a disability? 
* Does my application need to work across various different browsers and devices?
* Does my application need to work in multi-national and/or international environments? 
* How will my application perform when subjected to unexpected production loads?
* How can I ensure my applications is safe from security-related vulnerabilities?

Auth0 [Universal Login](/universal-login) and associated UI widgets (such as [Lock](/libraries/lock)) have already been designed and built following usability and accessibility best practices, and provide tested out-of-box support for a whole host of [browsers and devices](/support/matrix#browsers). Support for [internationalization](/i18n) (I18N) is also provided out-of-box, with built-in extensibility designed for custom multi-language and localization (L10N) situations.  

To ensure funcional requirements are met and unexpected events are handled correctly, guidance is provided for testing the [integration](#integration-testing) between your application(s) and Auth0, and for [unit testing](#unit-testing) individual extensibility modules (such as [Rules](/rules/guides/debug#try-this-rule), [Hooks](/hooks/guides/edit-hooks-using-dashboard#test-hooks), and Custom Database scripts). Guidance is also provided regarding Auth0's [penetration testing policy](/policies/penetration-testing) to help when testing for security vulnerability, and also how [Mock](#mock-testing) testing can be leveraged in conjunction with our [load testing policy](/policies/load-testing) to help ensure your application(s) perform under unexpected load.
