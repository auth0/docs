The reason that authentication systems are important is to prevent bad actors from accessing applications and user data that they should not. We want to place as many barriers as possible between those bad actors and access to our systems. One of the easiest ways to do this is to ensure that your [anomaly detection](/anomaly-detection) with Auth0 is configured correctly, so take a moment to read the guidance on this subject and ensure that it's working correctly for you.

::: panel Best Practice
Anomaly detection is handled behind the scenes by Auth0 and provides a great security feature for your product. If you're going to utilize it, ensure that you have set up your [Email Provider](/architecture-scenarios/implementation/${platform}/${platform}-operations#email-provider-setup) and configured your [Email Templates](/architecture-scenarios/implementation/${platform}/${platform}-branding#email-template-customization) before turning on email delivery to your users.
