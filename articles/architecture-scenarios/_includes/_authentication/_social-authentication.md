The “bring your own identity” scenario offered by Facebook, Google, etc., is a valuable way of simplifying the user authentication experience without compromising security, and using [Universal Login](#universal-login) makes it easy to start adding support for [Social Connections](/connections/identity-providers-social) with minimal disruption. 

::: warning
Auth0 provides a simple way to test social connections using [pre-configured developer keys](/connections/social/devkeys). However, these have [limitations](/connections/social/devkeys#limitations-of-developer-keys), and before going into production, you’ll need to set up your own application-specific keys by following the [instructions](/connections/identity-providers-social) for your chosen social provider(s).
:::

With [social](https://auth0.com/learn/social-login/) support, user identities and credentials are managed by the social provider, as are certain identity claims&mdash;which Auth0 will use to populate the user [profile](/architecture-scenarios/implementation/${platform}/${platform}-profile-mgmt). Auth0 can also provide access to Social Identity Providers' (Social IdPs') [Access Tokens](/tokens/overview-idp-access-tokens), so that your application can also call 3rd-party Social IdP APIs on behalf of the user.  

::: panel Best Practice
Social is a great feature to provide, but when you offer more than one way to sign in, you need to consider the possibility that your customers will actually use more than one way to sign in. By default, every user identity in Auth0 has its own user profile, so you’ll probably want to consider Auth0's capability to [Link User Accounts](/link-accounts) (a.k.a. Account Linking) to provide an effective way of associating one user profile with multiple identities.
:::

The Auth0 [Custom Social Connections extension](/extensions/custom-social-extensions) extends social authentication even further by allowing you to connect with any <dfn data-key="openid">[OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/protocols/oidc)</dfn> third-party-compliant vendor not supported out-of-box. For example, support for the government-issued-identity provider [SwissID](https://www.swissid.ch/) can be configured in Auth0 by using a Custom Social Connection and by following the guidance described in our [SwissID blog post](https://auth0.com/blog/configuring-swissid-login-into-custom-applications/).
