#### Signing Algorithms

When you create an API you have to select the algorithm your tokens will be signed with. The signature is used to verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way.

::: note
The signature is part of a JWT. If you are not familiar with the JWT structure please refer to: [JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in Auth0](/jwt#what-is-the-json-web-token-structure-).

To create the signature part you have to take the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, the algorithm specified in the header, and sign that. That algorithm, which is part of the JWT header, is the one you select for your API: `HS256` or `RS256`.

- __RS256__ is an [asymmetric algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography) which means that there are two keys: one public and one private (secret). Auth0 has the secret key, which is used to generate the signature, and the consumer of the JWT has the public key, which is used to validate the signature.
- __HS256__ is a [symmetric algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm) which means that there is only one secret key, shared between the two parties. The same key is used both to generate the signature and to validate it. Special care should be taken in order for the key to remain confidential.

The most secure practice, and our recommendation, is to use __RS256__. Some of the reasons are:

- With RS256 you are sure that only the holder of the private key (Auth0) can sign tokens, while anyone can check if the token is valid using the public key.
- Under HS256, If the private key is compromised you would have to re-deploy the API with the new secret. With RS256 you can request a token that is valid for multiple audiences.
- With RS256 you can implement key rotation without having to re-deploy the API with the new secret.
