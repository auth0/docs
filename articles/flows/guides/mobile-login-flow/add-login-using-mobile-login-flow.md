# Add Login Using the Mobile Login Flow

::: note
This tutorial will help you add login to your native/mobile app using the mobile login flow. If you want to learn how the flow works and why you should use it, see [Mobile Login Flow](/flows/concepts/mobile-login-flow). If you want to learn to call your API from a native/mobile app, see [Call Your API from a Native/Mobile App](/flows/guides/mobile-login-flow/call-api-using-mobile-login-flow).
:::

Auth0 makes it easy for your app to implement the mobile login flow using:

* [Auth0 Mobile SDKs](/libraries#auth0-sdks): The easiest way to implement the mobile login flow, which will do most of the heavy-lifting for you. Our [Mobile Quickstarts](/quickstart/native) will walk you through the process.
* Authentication API: If you prefer to roll your own, keep reading to learn how to call our API directly.

Following successful login, your application will have access to the user's [ID Token](/tokens/id-token) and [Access Token](/tokens/overview-access-tokens). The ID Token will contain basic user profile information, and the Access Token can be used to call the Auth0 /userinfo endpoint or your own protected APIs.

## Prerequisites

**Before beginning this tutorial:**

* [Register your Application with Auth0](/applications/guides/register-native-app). 
  * Select an **Application Type** of **Native**.
  * Add an **Allowed Callback URL** of **`YOUR_CALLBACK_URL`**. Your callback URL format will vary depending on your platform. For details about the format for your platform, see our [Native/Mobile Quickstarts](/quickstart/native).
  * Make sure your Application's **[Grant Types](/applications/guides/update-grant-types-dashboard)** include **Authorization Code**.

## Steps

Each time your user chooses to authenticate you will need to:

1. [Create a code verifier](#create-a-code-verifier): 
Generate a `code_verifier` that will be sent to Auth0 to request tokens.
2. [Create a code challenge](#create-a-code-challenge): 
Generate a `code_challenge` from the `code_verifier` that will be sent to Auth0 to request an `authorization_code`.
3. [Authorize the user](#authorize-the-user): 
Request the user's authorization and redirect back to your app with an `authorization_code`.
4. [Request Tokens](#request-tokens): 
Exchange your `authorization_code` and `code_verifier` for tokens.
