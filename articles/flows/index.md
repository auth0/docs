# Authentication and Authorization Flows

Auth0 uses [OpenID Connect](/protocols/oidc) and [OAuth 2.0](/protocols/oauth2) to authenticate users and get their authorization to access protected resources. With Auth0, you can easily support different flows in your own applications and APIs without worrying about the OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect specification, or the other technical aspects of authentication and authorization.

We support scenarios for server-side, mobile, desktop, client-side, and machine-to-machine applications:

* [Authorization Code Flow](/flows/concepts/auth-code)
  * [Add Login Using the Authorization Code Flow](/flows/guides/auth-code/add-login-auth-code)
  * [Call API Using the Authorization Code Flow](/flows/guides/auth-code/call-api-auth-code)
  
* [Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)](/flows/concepts/auth-code-pkce)
  * [Add Login Using the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/flows/guides/auth-code-pkce/add-login-auth-code-pkce)
  * [Call API Using the Authorization Code Flow with PKCE](/flows/guides/auth-code-pkce/call-api-auth-code-pkce)
  
* [Single-Page App Login Flow](/flows/concepts/implicit)
  * [Add Login Using the Implicit Flow](/flows/guides/implicit/add-login-implicit)
  * [Call API Using the Implicit Flow](/flows/guides/implicit/call-api-implicit)

* [Client Credentials Flow](/flows/concepts/client-credentials)
  * [Call API Using the Client Credentials Flow](/flows/guides/client-credentials/call-api-client-credentials)
