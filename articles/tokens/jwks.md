# JSON Web Key Set

At the most basic level, the JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) is a set of keys containing the public keys that should be used to verify any [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/jwt) issued by the authorization server. 

When creating applications and APIs in Auth0, two algorithms are supported for signing JWTs: **RS256** and **HS256**. RS256 generates an asymmetric signature, which means a private key must be used to sign the JWT and a different public key must be used to verify the signature.

Auth0 uses the [JSON Web Key (JWK) specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7517) to represent the cryptographic keys used for signing RS256 tokens. This specification defines two high-level data structures: **JSON Web Key (JWK)** and **JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)**. Here are the definitions directly from the specification:

| Item | Description |
| - | - |
| **JSON Web Key (JWK)** | A JSON object that represents a cryptographic key. The members of the object represent properties of the key, including its value. |
| **JSON Web Key Set (JWKS)** | A JSON object that represents a set of JWKs. The JSON object MUST have a `keys` member, which is an array of JWKs. |

Auth0 exposes a JWKS endpoint for each tenant, which is found at `https://${account.namespace}/.well-known/jwks.json`. This endpoint will contain the JWK used to sign all Auth0-issued JWTs for this tenant. 

::: note
Currently Auth0 only supports a single JWK for signing, however, it is important to assume this endpoint could contain multiple JWKs. As an example, multiple keys can be found in the JWKS when rotating signing certificates.
