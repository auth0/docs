# Auth0 `refresh_token`

Refresh tokens carry the information to get a new access token, this new token is then used to authenticate a user without them needing to re-authenticate. This is primarily useful for mobile applications that are installed on a device.  

Usually a user only gets a new access token after old ones have expired, or if gaining access to a new resource for the first time. Refresh tokens are usually subject to strict storage requirements to ensure they are not leaked. They can also be blacklisted by the authorization server. 

See the [Refresh Token](/refresh-token) page for information on how to obtain, view and revoke refresh tokens.
