# ID Token

## Overview

The ID Token is a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/jwt) that contains user profile information (such as the user's name and email) which is represented in the form of **claims**. These claims are statements about the user, which can be trusted if the consumer of the token can [verify its signature](/tokens/guides/id-token/validate-id-token#verify-the-signature).

You can [get an ID Token](/tokens/guides/id-token/get-id-tokens) for a user after they successfully authenticate.

::: warning
Î¥ou __must__ [validate the ID Token](/tokens/guides/id-token/validate-id-token) before storing and using it.
