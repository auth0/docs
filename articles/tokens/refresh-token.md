# Refresh Token

A **refresh token** is a special kind of [JWT](/jwt) that contains the information required to obtain a new `access_token` or `id_token`.

> An `id_token` is used by the client that receives it in order to identify the user. An `access_token` is used by a client to access an API. For more information refer to: [Tokens](/tokens).

Usually, a user will need a new access token only after the previous one expires, or when gaining access to a new resource for the first time.

Refresh tokens are subject to strict storage requirements to ensure that they are not leaked. Refresh tokens can also be blacklisted by the authorization server.

## Overview

The response of an [authentication request](/protocols) can result in an `access_token` and/or an `id_token` being issued by Auth0. The  `access_token` is used to make authenticated calls to a secured API, while the `id_token` contains user profile attributes represented in the form of _claims_. Both JWTs have an expiration date indicated by the `exp` claim (among other security measures, like signing).

A refresh token allows the application to request Auth0 to issue a new `access_token` or `id_token` directly, without needing to re-authenticate the user. This will work as long as the refresh token has not been revoked.

Refresh tokens can be issued for each combination of app, user and device. Once the Auth0 refresh token is issued, the values of the client, user, and device set during its creation cannot be changed.

::: panel-warning Secure Storage
Refresh tokens must be stored securely by an application since they allow a user to remain authenticated essentially forever.
:::

Refresh tokens can be [obtained](#obtain-a-refresh-token) or [revoked](#revoke-a-refresh-token-using-the-management-api) programmatically through the Auth0 API.

They can also be viewed and revoked [from the dashboard](#revoke-a-refresh-token-in-the-dashboard).

## Obtain a Refresh Token

To obtain a refresh token, the `offline_access` scope (see: [Scopes](/scopes)) and an arbitrary `device` name must be included when initiating an authentication request through the [authorize](/auth-api#!#get--offline-access) endpoint.

For example:

```
GET https://${account.namespace}/authorize/?
    response_type=token
    &client_id=${account.clientId}
    &redirect_uri=YOUR_CALLBACK_URL
    &state=VALUE_THAT_SURVIVES_REDIRECTS
    &scope=openid%20offline_access
    &device=my-device
```

**NOTE**: The `device` parameter can be any value, such as a unique mobile device identifier.

When the authentication flow completes, Auth0 will redirect the user to the `callback_URL` as usual.
The complete URL will be as follows:

```
GET https://YOUR_CALLBACK_URL#
    access_token=2nF...WpA
    &id_token=eyJhb...
    &state=VALUE_THAT_SURVIVES_REDIRECTS
    &refresh_token=Cqp...Mwe
```

The refresh token is returned as part of the URL, in the form of an opaque string.

**NOTE**: In this case, the token was returned to the client directly in the URL because the [implicit flow](/protocols#oauth2-implicit-flow) (`response_type=token`) was used.

## Use a Refresh Token

To obtain a new `id_token`, call the `/oauth/token` endpoint in the Authentication API, using `grant_type=refresh_token`.

::: panel-info Rate limits
Obtaining new tokens using the `refresh_token` should occur only if the `access_token` has expired or you want to refresh the claims contained in the `id_token`. For example, it is a bad practice to call the endpoint to get a new token every time you call an API using the `access_token`. There are rate limits in Auth0 that will throttle the amount of requests to this endpoint that can be executed using the same token from the same IP.

## Revoke a Refresh Token

Since refresh tokens never expire it is important to be able to revoke them.

### Revoke a Refresh Token using the Management API

To revoke a refresh token using the Auth0 Management API, you need the `id` of the refresh token you wish to revoke. To obtain a list of existing refresh tokens, call the [List device credentials](/api/management/v2#!/Device_Credentials/get_device_credentials) endpoint, specifying `type=refresh_token` with an access token containing `read:device_credentials` scope. To narrow the results, you can also specify the `client_id` and `user_id` associated with the token, if known.

```
GET https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/device-credentials?
  type=refresh_token
  &client_id={}
  &user_id={}

{
  "Authorization":   "Bearer {your_access_token}"
}
```

Response body:

```
[
  {
    "id": "dcr_dFJiaAxbEroQ5xxx",
    "device_name": "my-device" // the value of 'device' provided in the /authorize call when creating the token
  }
]
```

To revoke a __refresh token__, call the [Delete a device credential](/api/management/v2#!/Device_Credentials/delete_device_credentials_by_id) endpoint with an access token containing `delete:device_credentials` scope and the value of `id` obtained above:

```
DELETE https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/device-credentials/{id}

{
  "Authorization":   "Bearer {your_access_token}"
}

```

The response will be a **204**: The credential no longer exists.

### Revoke a Refresh Token in the Dashboard

To see if a user has existing devices with associated refresh tokens, go to the [Users section](${manage_url}/#/users) of the dashboard. Click the name of the user to view their **Details** page.

Select the **Devices** tab. This page lists all device names and the number of refresh tokens associated with each. To revoke a refresh token, click the **X** to the right of the device name.

## SDK Support

The [Lock](/libraries/lock), [auth0.js](/libraries/auth0js), and [auth0-angular.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-angular) libraries include support methods to obtain and use refresh tokens.
