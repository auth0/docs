# How to Enable Third-Party Cookies

In order to use a certain kind of authentication ([cross-origin authentication](/cross-origin-authentication)) to safely and securely sign in to various apps and services, a feature called "third-party cookies" is required. If you are using a particular web browser (such as Chrome and Opera on desktop or Android devices), signing in via cross-origin authentication can fail if third-party cookies are disabled in your browser.

If you're reading this document, it's entirely possible that third-party cookies in **your** browser are disabled. Usually, third-party cookies are enabled by default, but if yours are disabled, for whatever reason, here is how you can enable them:

## Enable Third-Party Cookies in Chrome

In Chrome, to enable third-party cookies, head to your Chrome Settings, and then click the "Advanced" tab at the bottom.
