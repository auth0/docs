# Calling APIs from Mobile Apps

The OAuth 2.0 grant that mobile apps utilize in order to access an API, is the **Authorization Code Grant using Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)**.

## Overview

The **Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)**, defined in [RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636), is a technique used to mitigate the authorization code interception attack when using the [Authorization Code Grant](/api-auth/grant/authorization-code) since the attacker can intercept the `authorization_code` returned by the Authorization Server and exchange it for an `access_token` (and possibly a `refresh_token`).
To mitigate this attack, the Client creates, for every authorization request, a cryptographically random key called `code_verifier` and it's transformed value called `code_challenge`, which is sent to the Authorization Server to obtain the `authorization_code`. When the Client receives the `authorization_code`, it will send the code and the `code_verifier` to the Authorization Server token endpoint to exchange them for the requested tokens.

 1. The Client initiates the flow and redirects the user to the Authorization Server sending the `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method` parameters
 2. The Authorization Server redirects the user to the Client with an `authorization_code` in the querystring
 3. The Client sends the `authorization_code` and `code_verifier` together with the Redirect Uri and the Client Id to the Authorization Server
 4. The Authorization Server validates this information and returns an `access_token` (and optionally a `refresh_token`)

## Use Case

 - Allow a Public Client to use the Authorization Code Grant without being susceptible to authorization code interception attack.
 - The Client is typically an Android or iOS Application.
