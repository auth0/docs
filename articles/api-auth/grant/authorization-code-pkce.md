# Calling APIs from Mobile Apps

In order to access an API from a [mobile app](/quickstart/native), you need to implement the **Authorization Code using Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** OAuth 2.0 grant. In this document we will see how this flow works.

## Overview of the flow

The [Authorization Code Grant](/api-auth/grant/authorization-code) has some security issues, when implemented on native applications. For instance, a malicious attacker can intercept the `authorization_code` returned by Auth0 and exchange it for an [Access Token](/tokens/access-token) (and possibly a [Refresh Token](/tokens/preview/refresh-token)).

The **Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** (defined in [RFC 7636](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7636)) is a technique used to mitigate this authorization code interception attack.

With PKCE, the Client creates, for every authorization request, a cryptographically random key called `code_verifier` and its transformed value called `code_challenge`, which is sent to Auth0 to get the `authorization_code`. When the Client receives the `authorization_code`, it will send the code and the `code_verifier` to Auth0's token endpoint to exchange them for the requested tokens.

 1. The native app initiates the flow and redirects the user to Auth0 (specifically to the [/authorize endpoint](/api/authentication#authorization-code-grant-pkce-)), sending the `code_challenge` and `code_challenge_method` parameters.

 2. Auth0 redirects the user to the native app with an `authorization_code` in the querystring.

 3. The native app sends the `authorization_code` and `code_verifier` together with the `redirect_uri` and the `client_id` to Auth0. This is done using the [/oauth/token endpoint](/api/authentication?http#authorization-code-pkce-).

 4. Auth0 validates this information and returns an `access_token` (and optionally a `refresh_token`).

 5. The native app can use the `access_token` to call the API on behalf of the user.

 __NOTE__: In OAuth 2.0 terms, the native app is the _Client_ , the end user the _Resource Owner_, the API the _Resource Server_, the browser the _User Agent_, and Auth0 the _Authorization Server_.

## How to implement the flow

For details on how to implement this using Auth0, refer to [Execute an Authorization Code Grant Flow with PKCE](/api-auth/tutorials/authorization-code-grant-pkce).

## Rules

[Rules](/rules) will run for the Authorization Code (PKCE) grant. If you wish to execute special logic unique to the Authorization Code grant, you can look at the `context.protocol` property in your rule. If the value is `oidc-basic-profile`, then the rule is running during the Authorization Code grant.

For details on how to implement this, refer to [Execute an Authorization Code Grant Flow with PKCE: Customize the Tokens](/api-auth/tutorials/authorization-code-grant-pkce#optional-customize-the-tokens).
