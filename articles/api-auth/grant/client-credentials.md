# Calling APIs from a Service

<%= include('../../_includes/_pipeline2') %>

The OAuth 2.0 grant that machine to machine interfaces utilize in order to access an API, is the **Client Credentials Grant**. In this document we will see how this flow works.

::: note
If you need a refresher on the OAuth 2.0 protocol, you can go through our [OAuth 2.0](/protocols/oauth2) article.

## Overview of the flow

With the **Client Credentials Grant** (defined in [RFC 6749, section 4.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)) a Machine to Machine Client (a CLI, a daemon, or a Service running on your backend), can directly ask Auth0 for an Access Token, by using its client credentials (__Client Id__ and __Client Secret__) to authenticate. In this case the token represents the client itself, instead of an end user.

1. The application authenticates with Auth0 using its __Client Id__ and __Client Secret__.

1. Auth0 validates this information and returns an Access Token.

1. The application can use the Access Token to call the API on behalf of itself.

::: note
In OAuth 2.0 terms, the non interactive app is the Client, the end user the Resource Owner, the API the Resource Server, the browser the User Agent, and Auth0 the Authorization Server.

## How to implement the flow

For details on how to implement this using Auth0, refer to [Execute a Client Credentials Grant](/api-auth/tutorials/client-credentials). Before you do so, you have to set up the Grant first either [using the Dashboard](/api-auth/config/using-the-auth0-dashboard) or [using the Management API](/api-auth/config/using-the-management-api).
