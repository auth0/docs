# Calling APIs from a Service

The [OAuth 2.0](/protocols/oauth2) grant that machine-to-machine interfaces utilize in order to access an API, is the **Client Credentials Grant**. In this document we will see how this flow works.

## Overview of the flow

With **Client Credentials Grant** (defined in [RFC 6749, section 4.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)) a Non Interactive Client (a CLI, a daemon, or a Service running on your backend), can directly ask Auth0 for an `access_token`, by using its Client Credentials (__Client Id__ and __Client Secret__) to authenticate. In this case the token represents the Non Interactive Client itself, instead of an end user.

1. The application authenticates with Auth0 using its __Client Id__ and __Client Secret__.

1. Auth0 validates this information and returns an `access_token`.

1. The application can use the `access_token` to call the API on behalf of itself.

::: note
In OAuth 2.0 terms, the non interactive app is the Client, the end user the Resource Owner, the API the Resource Server, the browser the User Agent, and Auth0 the Authorization Server.

## How to implement the flow

For details on how to implement this using Auth0, refer to [Execute a Client Credentials Grant](/api-auth/tutorials/client-credentials). Before you do so, you have to set up the Grant first either [using the Dashboard](/api-auth/config/using-the-auth0-dashboard) or [using the Management API](/api-auth/config/using-the-management-api).
