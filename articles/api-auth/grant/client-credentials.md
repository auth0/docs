# Calling APIs from a Service

The OAuth 2.0 grant that machine-to-machine interfaces utilize in order to access an API, is the **Client Credentials Grant**. In this document we will see how this flow works.

## Overview of the flow

With **Client Credentials Grant** (defined in [RFC 6749, section 4.4](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.4)) a Non Interactive Client (a CLI, a daemon, or a Service running on your backend), can directly ask Auth0 for an `access_token`, by using its Client Credentials (__Client Id__ and __Client Secret__) to authenticate. In this case the token represents the Non Interactive Client itself, instead of an end user.

1. The application authenticates with Auth0 using its __Client Id__ and __Client Secret__.

1. Auth0 validates this information and returns an `access_token`.

1. The application can use the `access_token` to call the API on behalf of itself.

  __NOTE__: In OAuth 2.0 terms, the non interactive app is the _Client_, the end user the _Resource Owner_, the API the _Resource Server_, the browser the _User Agent_, and Auth0 the _Authorization Server_.

## How to implement the flow

For details on how to implement this using Auth0, refer to [Execute a Client Credentials Grant](/api-auth/tutorials/client-credentials). Before you do so, you have to set up the Grant first either [using the Dashboard](/api-auth/config/using-the-auth0-dashboard) or [using the Management API](/api-auth/config/using-the-management-api).
