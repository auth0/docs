1. Open the Auth0 Management Dashboard and browse to the [Applications section](${manage_url}/#/applications).

2. Click on **Create Application** to begin creating a new application (if you have multiple applications needing access to the API, you'll need to create an Auth0 app for *each*). You'll be asked what type of application you'd like to create, so select **Machine to Machine Application**. Click **Create** to proceed.

3. Navigate to the [API section](${manage_url}/#/apis) and create a new API.

Enter a friendly name and an identifier. Ideally, this identifier should be the public endpoint of the API, but any valid URN is acceptable. This API will be represented by your **Resource Server**.

The selection of the **Signing Algorithm** will dictate how the API will validate the Access Tokens it receives:
* HS256 (symmetric): signed using the resource server's signing secret
* RS256 (asymmetric): signed using Auth0's private key for your account. Verification is done using the corresponding public key, which can be found at the following standard [JWKS (JSON Web Key set)](/jwks) URL: [https://${account.namespace}/.well-known/jwks.json](https://${account.namespace}/.well-known/jwks.json)

::: note
There will already be an `Auth0 Management API` that represents Auth0's APIv2. You can authorize applications to request tokens from this API as well.

4. (Optional) Define some scopes by browsing to the **Scopes** tab. A scope is a claim that may be issued as part of the Access Token. With this information, the API can enforce fine-grained authorization.

5. Authorize a consumer application. Under the **Machine to Machine Application** tab, you can authorize your applications that will be the consumers of the API. This will create a `client grant` for each application and will allow you to generate Access Tokens for these applications to call your API. Optionally, you can select a subset of scopes to be granted to this application as part of the Access Token. Scopes allow the API to enforce fine-grained authorization.

6. Setup your API to accept Access Tokens. The **Quickstart** tab provides you with code snippets for different languages and will guide you through bootstrapping your API, depending on the selected **Signing Algorithm**.
