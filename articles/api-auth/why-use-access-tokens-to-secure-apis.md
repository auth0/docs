# Why you should always use Access Tokens to secure an API

<%= include('../_includes/_pipeline2') %>

There is much confusion on the Web about the differences between the OpenID Connect and OAuth 2.0 specifications, and their respective tokens. As a result many developers publish insecure applications, compromising their users security. The contradicting implementations between identity providers do not help either.

This article is an attempt to clear what is what and explain why you should always use an [Access Token](/tokens/access-token) to secure an API, and never an [ID Token](/tokens/id-token).

## Two complementary specifications

OAuth 2.0 is used to __grant authorization__. It enables you to authorize the Web App A to access your information from Web App B, without sharing your credentials. It was built with _only_ authorization in mind and doesn't include any authentication mechanisms (in other words, it doesn't give the Authorization Server any way of verifying who the user is).

OpenID Connect builds on OAuth 2.0. It enables you, the user, to verify your identity and give some basic profile information, without sharing your credentials.

An example is a to-do application which lets you log in using your Google account and can push your to-do items, as calendar entries, to your Google Calendar. The part where you authenticate your identity is implemented via OpenID Connect, while the part where you authorize the to-do application to modify your calendar by adding entries, is implemented via OAuth 2.0.

::: note
  OpenID Connect is about who someone is. OAuth 2.0 is about what they are allowed to do.
:::

You may have noticed the _"without sharing your credentials"_ part, in our definitions of the two specifications earlier. What you do share in both cases are **tokens**.

OpenID Connect issues an identity token, known as an ID Token, while OAuth 2.0 issues an Access Token.

## How to use each token

The ID Token is a [JWT](/jwt) and is meant for the application only. In the example we used earlier, when you authenticate using Google, an ID Token is sent from Google to the to-do application, that says who you are. The to-do application can parse [the token's contents](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims) and use this information, like your name and your profile picture, to customize the user experience.

::: warning
You must never use the info in an ID Token unless you have validated it! For more information refer to: [How to validate an ID Token](/tokens/id-token#validate-an-id-token). For a list of libraries you can use to verify a JWT refer to [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/).
:::

The Access Token can be any type of token (not necessarily a JWT) and is meant for the API. Its purpose is to inform the API that the bearer of this token has been authorized to access the API and perform specific actions (as specified by the `scope` that has been granted). In the example we used earlier, after you authenticate, and provide your consent that the to-do application can have read/write access to your calendar, an Access Token is sent from Google to the to-do application. Each time the to-do application wants to access your Google Calendar it will make a request to the Google Calendar API, using this Access Token in an HTTP `Authorization` header.

::: note
  Access Tokens should be treated as opaque strings by applications. They are only meant for the API. Your application should not attempt to decode them or depend on a particular Access Token format.

## How NOT to use each token

Now that we've seen what these tokens can be used for, let's see what they cannot be used for.

- __An Access Token cannot be used for authentication__. It holds no authenticating information about the user (in fact, the only identifying information about the user is their ID, located in the `sub` claim). It cannot tell us if the user has authenticated and when.

- __An ID Token cannot be used for API access__. Each token contains information on the intended audience (recipient). According to the OpenID Connect specification, the audience (claim `aud`) of each ID Token must be the `client_id` of the application making the authentication request. If it isn't you shouldn't trust the token. An API, on the other hand, expects a token with the audience set to the API's unique identifier. So unless you are in control of both the application and the API, sending an ID Token to an API will not work. Furthermore, the ID Token is signed with a secret that is known to the application (since it is issued to a particular application). This means that if an API were to accept such token, it would have no way of knowing if the application has modified the token (to add more scopes) and then signed it again.

## Compare Tokens

To better understand what we just read, let's look at the contents of example tokens.

The (decoded) contents of an ID Token look like the following:

```json
{
  "iss": "http://${account.namespace}/",
  "sub": "auth0|123456",
  "aud": "${account.clientId}",
  "exp": 1311281970,
  "iat": 1311280970,
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "given_name": "Jane",
  "family_name": "Doe",
  "gender": "female",
  "birthdate": "0000-10-31",
  "email": "janedoe@example.com",
  "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
}
```

This token is meant for __authenticating the user to the application__. Note that the audience (`aud` claim) of the token is set to the application's identifier, which means that only this specific application should consume this token.

For comparison, let's look at the contents of an Access Token:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://${account.namespace}/",
  "sub": "auth0|123456",
  "aud": [
    "my-api-identifier",
    "https://${account.namespace}/userinfo"
  ],
  "azp": "${account.clientId}",
  "exp": 1489179954,
  "iat": 1489143954,
  "scope": "openid profile email address phone read:appointments email"
}
```

This token is meant for __authorizing the user to the API__. As such, it is completely opaque to applications, meaning that an application should not care about the contents of this token, decode it or depend on a particular token format. Note that the token does not contain any information about the user itself besides their ID (`sub` claim), it only contains authorization information about which actions the application is allowed to perform at the API (`scope` claim).

Since in many cases it is desirable to retrieve additional user information at the API, this token is also valid for calling the `/userinfo` API, which will return the user's profile information. So the intented audience (`aud` claim) of the token is either the API (`my-api-identifier`) or the `/userinfo` endpoint (`https://${account.namespace}/userinfo`).
