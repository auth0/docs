## Overview

An API is an entity that represents an external resource, capable of accepting and responding to protected resource requests made by applications. At the [OAuth2 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749) an API maps to the **Resource Server**.

When an application wants to access an API's protected resources it must provide an [Access Token](/tokens/concepts/overview-access-tokens). The same Access Token can be used to access the API's resources without having to authenticate again, until it expires.

Each API has a set of defined permissions. Applications can request a subset of those defined permissions when they execute the authorization flow, and include them in the Access Token as part of the **scope** request parameter.

For example, an API that holds a user's appointments, may accept two different levels of authorization: read only (scope `read:appointments`) or write (scope `write:appointments`). When an application asks the API to list a user's appointments, then the Access Token should contain the `read:appointments` scope. In order to edit an existing appointment or create a new one, the Access Token should contain the `write:appointments` scope.
