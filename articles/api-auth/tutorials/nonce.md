# Mitigate replay attacks when using the Implicit Grant

<%= include('../../_includes/_pipeline2') %>

When using the [Implicit Grant](/api-auth/grant/implicit), a [cryptographic nonce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_nonce) must be sent on authentication requests in order to mitigate replay attacks [as required by the OpenID Connect specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitAuthRequest).
The nonce is generated by the application, sent as a `nonce` query string parameter in the authentication request, and included in the ID Token response from Auth0.
This allows applications to correlate the ID Token response from Auth0 with the initial authentication request.

## Generate a cryptographically random nonce

[Modern browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=cryptography) can use the [Web Crypto API](https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/) to generate cryptographically secure random strings for use as nonces.

```js
function randomString(length) {
    var bytes = new Uint8Array(length);
    var random = window.crypto.getRandomValues(bytes);
    var result = [];
    var charset = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz-._~'
    random.forEach(function (c) {
        result.push(charset[c % charset.length]);
    });
    return result.join('');
}
```

## Persist nonces across requests

The generated nonce must be persisted in your web application using any of the following methods:

* `HttpOnly` session cookie
* HTML5 local storage value

For example:

```js
window.localStorage.setItem('nonce', randomString(16));
```

## Validate the ID Token

Once Auth0 responds with an ID Token, this token must be validated and decoded as usual.
Its `nonce` claim must contain the exact same value that was sent in the request.
If not, authentication should be rejected by the application.

```js
var jwt = '...'; // validated and decoded ID Token body
if (jwt.nonce === window.localStorage.getItem('nonce')) {
    // Nonce is OK
} else {
    // Nonce is not OK! Token replay attack might be underway
}
```
