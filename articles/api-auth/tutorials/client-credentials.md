# How to Implement the Client Credentials Grant

<%= include('../../_includes/_pipeline2') %>

Before beginning this tutorial, please:

* Check that your Application's [Grant Type property](/applications/application-grant-types) is set appropriately
* [Register the API](/apis#how-to-configure-an-api-in-auth0) with Auth0

## Ask for a token

To ask Auth0 for tokens for any of your authorized applications, perform a `POST` operation to the `https://${account.namespace}/oauth/token` endpoint with a payload in the following format:

```har
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://${account.namespace}/oauth/token",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" }
  ],
  "postData": {
    "mimeType": "application/json",
    "text": "{\"grant_type\":\"client_credentials\",\"client_id\": \"${account.clientId}\",\"client_secret\": \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\",\"audience\": \"YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER\"}"
  }
}
```

Where:

* `grant_type`: This must be `client_credentials`.
* `client_id`: Your application's Client ID. You can find this value at the [Settings tab of the Machine to Machine Application](${manage_url}/#/applications).
* `client_secret`: Your application's Client Secret. You can find this value at the [Settings tab of the Machine to Machine Application](${manage_url}/#/applications).
* `audience`: The **Identifier** value on the [Settings](${manage_url}/#/apis) tab for the API you created as part of the prerequisites for this tutorial.

The response contains a [signed JSON Web Token](/jwt), the token's type (which is `Bearer`), and in how much time it expires in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) (86400 seconds, which means 24 hours).

```json
{
  "access_token":"eyJz93a...k4laUWw",
  "token_type":"Bearer",
  "expires_in":86400
}
```

If you [decode the `access_token`](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) you will see that it contains the following claims:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://${account.namespace}/",
  "sub": "YOUR_NON_INTERACTIVE_CLIENT_ID@clients",
  "aud": "YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER",
  "exp": 1489715431, // unix timestamp of the token's expiration date,
  "iat": 1489679431, // unix timestamp of the token's creation date,
  "scope": ""
}
```

## Modify scopes and claims

You can change the scopes and add custom claims to the `access_token` you got, using [Hooks](/hooks).

Hooks allow you to customize the behavior of Auth0 using Node.js code. They are actually Webtasks, associated with specific extensibility points of the Auth0 platform (like the Client Credentials grant). Auth0 invokes the Hooks at runtime to execute your custom logic.

For more information and details on how to do that refer to [Using Hooks with Client Credentials Grant](/api-auth/tutorials/client-credentials/customize-with-hooks).


## Verify the token

Once your API receives a request with a Bearer `access_token`, the first thing to do is to validate the token. This consists of a series of steps, and if any of these fails then the request _must_ be rejected.

For details on the validations that should be performed by the API, refer to [Verify Access Tokens](/api-auth/tutorials/verify-access-token).

## Sample application

For an example implementation see the [Server Client + API](/architecture-scenarios/application/server-api) architecture scenario. 

This is a series of tutorials that describe a scenario for a fictitious company that wants to implement a Timesheets API and send timesheets entries from a server process using OAuth 2.0. The tutorials are accompanied by a sample that you can access in [GitHub](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-pnp-exampleco-timesheets).
