# Using Hooks with Client Credentials Grant

<%= include('../../../_includes/_pipeline2') %>

You can now add [Hooks](/hooks) into your [client credentials](/api-auth/grant/client-credentials) flow. This way you can change the scopes and add custom claims to the tokens issued by Auth0.

## Overview

Hooks allow you to customize the behavior of Auth0 using Node.js code.

They are actually [Webtasks](https://webtask.io/), associated with specific extensibility points of the Auth0 platform (like the Client Credentials grant). Auth0 invokes the Hooks at runtime to execute your custom logic.

You can manage Hooks using the [Auth0 Dashboard](/hooks/dashboard) or the [Auth0 Command Line Interface (CLI)](/hooks/cli). In this article we will see how you can do either.

## Before you start

Please ensure that:

- You have created an [API defined with the appropriate scopes](${manage_url}/#/apis)
- You have created a [machine to machine application](${manage_url}/#/applications) that is authorized to use the API created in the previous step

If you haven't done these yet, refer to these docs for details:
- How to set up a Client Credentials Grant:
  - [Using the Dashboard](/api-auth/config/using-the-auth0-dashboard)
  - [Using the Management API](/api-auth/config/using-the-management-api)
- [How to execute a Client Credentials Grant](/api-auth/config/asking-for-access-tokens)

## Use the Dashboard

1. Go to [the Hooks page of the Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/hooks).

  ![Dashboard Hooks](/media/articles/api-auth/hooks/dashboard-hooks.png)

2. Click the __+ Create New Hook__ button. On the _New Hook_ pop-up window, set the __Hook__ dropdown to `Client Credentials Exchange` and set a __Name__ for your hook. Click __Create__.

  ![New Client Credentials Hook](/media/articles/api-auth/hooks/new-cc-hook.png)

  At this point, you will see your newly-created Hook listed under the _Client Credentials Exchange_.

::: note
You can create more than one hooks per extensibility point but __only one__ can be enabled. The enabled hook will then be executed for __all__ applications and APIs.
:::

3. Click the __Pencil and Paper__ icon to the right of the Hook to open the Webtask Editor.

  ![Edit Client Credentials Hook](/media/articles/api-auth/hooks/edit-cc-hook.png)

4. Using the Webtask Editor, write your Node.js code. As an example, we will add an extra scope. The claim's name will be `https://foo.com/claim` and its value `bar`. Copy the sample code below and paste it in the Editor.

  ```js
  module.exports = function(client, scope, audience, context, cb) {
    var access_token = {};
    access_token['https://foo.com/claim'] = 'bar';
    access_token.scope = scope;
    access_token.scope.push('extra');
    cb(null, access_token);
  };
  ```

  This sample hook will:
  - add an arbitrary claim (`https://foo.com/claim`) to the `access_token`
  - add an `extra` scope to the default scopes configured on your [API](${manage_url}/#/apis).

  ::: panel Custom claims namespaced format
  In order to improve compatibility for applications, Auth0 now returns profile information in a [structured claim format as defined by the OIDC specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims). This means that in order to add custom claims to ID Tokens or Access Tokens, they must [conform to a namespaced format](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/scope-custom-claims) to avoid possible collisions with standard OIDC claims. For example, if you choose the namespace `https://foo.com/` and you want to add a custom claim named `claim`, you would name the claim `https://foo.com/claim`, instead of just `claim`.

  ![Webtask Editor](/media/articles/api-auth/hooks/cc-webtask-editor.png)

  Click __Save__ (or hit Ctrl+S/Cmd+S) and close the Editor.

5. That's it! Now you only need to test your hook. You can find detailed instructions at the [Test your Hook](#test-your-hook) paragraph.

## Use the Auth0 CLI

1. Make sure you have installed the Webtask CLI. You can find detailed instructions in the [Dashboard's Webtask page](${manage_url}/#/account/webtasks).

2. Create a file with your Node.js code. For our example, we will name the file `myrule.js` and copy the following code:

  ```js
  module.exports = function(client, scope, audience, context, cb) {
    var access_token = {};
    access_token['https://foo.com/claim'] = 'bar';
    access_token.scope = scope;
    access_token.scope.push('extra');
    cb(null, access_token);
  };
  ```

3. Create the Webtask. The command is the following:

  ```text
  auth0 create -t credentials-exchange -n client-credentials-exchange-hook -p ${account.namespace}-default file.js
  ```

  Let's break this down:
  - `auth0`: The binary to use.
  - `create`: The sub-command for creating or updating a Hook. Run in your terminal `auth0 -h` to see the rest.
  - `-t credentials-exchange`: The hook type. For this use case, set to `credentials-exchange`.
  - `-n client-credentials-exchange-hook`: The webtask's name. Set this to your preference, we chose `client-credentials-exchange-hook`.
  - `-p ${account.namespace}-default`: Your account's profile name. Get this value from _Step 2_ of the instructions on the [Dashboard's Webtask page](${manage_url}/#/account/webtasks).
  - `file.js`: The name of the file you created in the previous step.

  Run the command.

4. You will see a message that your hook was created, but in disabled state. To enable the hook, run the command:

  ```text
  auth0 enable --profile ${account.namespace}-default client-credentials-exchange-hook
  ```

  Where `client-credentials-exchange-hook` is the name of the webtask, and `${account.namespace}-default` the name of your profile (the same as the one used in the previous step).

5. That's it! Now you only need to test your hook. You can find detailed instructions at the [Test your Hook](#test-your-hook) paragraph.

## Test your Hook

To test the hook you just created you need to run a Client Credentials exchange, get the `access_token`, decode it and review its contents.

To get a token, make a `POST` request at the `https://${account.namespace}/oauth/token` API endpoint, with a payload in the following format.

```har
{
  "method": "POST",
  "url": "https://${account.namespace}/oauth/token",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" }
  ],
  "postData": {
    "mimeType": "application/json",
    "text": "{\"grant_type\":\"client_credentials\",\"client_id\": \"${account.clientId}\",\"client_secret\": \"YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET\",\"audience\": \"YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER\"}"
  }
}
```

::: note
If you don't know where to find the Client Id, Client Secret, or API Identifier information, refer to <a href="/api-auth/config/asking-for-access-tokens#where-to-find-the-ids">Where to Find the IDs</a>.
:::

A successful response will include:
- an `access_token`,
- its expiration time in seconds (`expires_in`),
- the token's type set as `Bearer` (`token_type`), and
- an `extra` scope (`scope`) (this scope was added by your hook)

```text
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
{
  "access_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6Ik5ESTFNa05DTVRGQlJrVTRORVF6UXpFMk1qZEVNVVEzT1VORk5ESTVSVU5GUXpnM1FrRTFNdyJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL2RlbW8tYWNjb3VudC5hdXRoMC3jb20vIiwic3ViIjoic0FRSlFpQmYxREw0c2lqSVZCb2pFRUZvcmRoa0o4WUNAY2xpZW50cyIsImF1ZCI6ImRlbW8tYWNjb3VudC5hcGkiLCJleHAiOjE0ODc3NjU8NjYsImlhdCI6MTQ4NzY3OTI2Niwic2NvcGUiOiJyZWFkOmRhdGEgZXh0cmEiLCJodHRwczovL2Zvby5jb20vY2xhaW0iOiKoPXIifQ.da-48mHY_7esfLZpvHWWL8sIH1j_2mUYAB49c-B472lCdsNFvpaLoq6OKQyhnqk9_aW_Xhfkusos3FECTrLFvf-qwQK70QtwbkbVye_IuPSTAYdQ2T-XTzGDm9Nmmy5Iwl9rNYLxVs2OoCdfpVMyda0OaI0AfHBgEdKWluTP67OOnV_dF3KpuwtK3dPKWTCo2j9VCa7X1I4h0CNuM79DHhY2wO7sL8WBej7BSNA3N2TUsp_YTWWfrvsr_vVhJf-32G7w_12ms_PNFUwj2C30ZZIPWc-uEkDztyMLdI-lu9q9TLrLdr0dOhfrtfkdeJx4pUSiHdJHf42kg7UAVK6JcA",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "scope": "extra",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Copy the `access_token`.

The easiest way to decode it and review its contents is to use the [JWT.io Debugger](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io).

Paste your `access_token` at the left-hand editor. Automatically the JWT is decoded and its contents are displayed on the right-hand editor.

![Decode Token with JWT.io](/media/articles/api-auth/hooks/cc-decode-token.png)

Look into the last two items of the __Payload__. Both have been set by our hook:
- `"scope": "extra"`
- `"https://foo.com/claim": "bar"`

## Manage your Hooks

You can disable, enable, delete or edit hooks using either the Auth0 CLI or the [dashboard]((${manage_url}/#/hooks)). You can also review your logs using the Auth0 CLI. For details, refer to the articles below.

Use the Dashboard to:
- [Delete Hooks](/auth0-hooks/dashboard/create-delete)
- [Edit Hooks](/auth0-hooks/dashboard/edit)
- [Enable or disable Hooks](/auth0-hooks/dashboard/enable-disable)

Use the Auth0 CLI to:
- [Delete Hooks](/auth0-hooks/cli/create-delete)
- [Edit Hooks](/auth0-hooks/cli/edit)
- [Enable or disable Hooks](/auth0-hooks/cli/enable-disable)
- [Review Logs](/auth0-hooks/cli/logs)

## Webtask Input Parameters

As you saw in our example, the webtask takes five input parameters. You can use these values for your custom logic.

Let's see what each one contains.

- __client__ (object): Information on the application asking for the token, including the `client` metadata (a key-value pair that can be set by application). Sample snippet:

    ```json
    {
      "tenant":  "tenant_name",
      "id": "tenant_id",
      "name": "test_client",
      "metadata": {
        "some_metadata": "value"
      }
    }
    ```

- __scope__ (`string array`): The scopes available on the API that you have defined.

- __audience__ (`string`): The API identifier available via the API settings page.

- __context__ (`object`): The contextual information about the request. Sample snippet:

    ```json
    {
      "ip": "123.123.123.123",
      "userAgent": "...",
      "webtask": {
        "secrets": { "FOO": "bar" }
      }
    }
    ```

- __cb__: The callback. In our example we returned the token (`cb(null, access_token)`). If you decide, however, not to issue a token, you can return `Error (cb(new Error('access denied')))`.
