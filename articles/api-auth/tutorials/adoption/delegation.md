# Delegation and the OIDC-conformant pipeline

<%= include('./_about.md') %>

[Delegation](/api/authentication#delegation) is used for many operations, depending on your particular use case:

* Exchanging an ID Token issued to one application for a new one issued to a different application
* Using a Refresh Token to obtain a fresh ID Token
* Exchanging an ID Token for a third-party API token, such as Firebase or AWS.

Given that [ID Tokens should no longer be used as API tokens](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/api-tokens) and that [Refresh Tokens should be used only at the token endpoint](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/refresh-tokens), this endpoint is now considered deprecated.

Applications marked as [OIDC-conformant](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/oidc-conformant) cannot be the source or target of Auth0-to-Auth0 delegation requests.

## Third-party APIs (such as Firebase or AWS)

At the moment there is no OIDC-compliant mechanism to obtain third-party API tokens.
In order to facilitate a gradual migration to the new authentication pipeline, delegation can still be used to obtain third-party API tokens.
This will be deprecated in future releases.
