# Delegation and the OIDC-conformant pipeline

<%= include('./_about.md') %>

[Delegation](/api/authentication#delegation) is used for many operations, depending on your particular use case:

* Exchanging an ID token issued to one client for a new one issued to a different client
* Using a refresh token to obtain a fresh ID token
* Exchanging an ID token for a third-party API token, such as Firebase or AWS.

Given that [ID tokens should no longer be used as API tokens](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/api-tokens) and that [refresh tokens should be used only at the token endpoint](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/refresh-tokens), this endpoint is now considered deprecated.

Clients marked as [OIDC-conformant](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/oidc-conformant) cannot be the source or target of Auth0-to-Auth0 delegation requests.

::: note
For details on how to migrate your delegation implementation to the new flow, refer to the [Using Delegation for Token Exchange Migration Guide](/legacy/migration-guides/delegation-for-token-exchange).
:::

## Third-party APIs (Firebase, AWS, etc.)

At the moment there is no OIDC-compliant mechanism to obtain third-party API tokens.
In order to facilitate a gradual migration to the new authentication pipeline, delegation can still be used to obtain third-party API tokens.
This will be deprecated in future releases.
