Calling your APIs with Auth0 tokens
===================================

<%= include('./_about.md') %>

A fundamental change happening on the OIDC conformant pipeline is that **ID tokens should never be used as API tokens**. Instead, client applications and APIs (resource servers) should be defined as separate Auth0 entities, which allows you to obtain access tokens for your own APIs. This enables simpler integrations of APIs, since each API is no longer tied to the client applications that make calls to it. It also enables machine to machine integration scenarios, since [clients can authenticate as themselves](/api-auth/grant/client-credentials) (i.e. not on behalf on any user) to programmatically and securely obtain an API token. For example, [the Auth0 Management API is already defined as a resource server on your Auth0 domain](${manage_url}/#/apis/management/settings). You can authorize clients to obtain API tokens with specific scopes in a secure way.

One way to understand the reason for this is by looking at the contents of example tokens which conform to the OIDC specification:

```json
{
  "iss": "http://my-domain.auth0.com",
  "sub": "auth0|123456",
  "aud": "my_client_id",
  "exp": 1311281970,
  "iat": 1311280970,
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "given_name": "Jane",
  "family_name": "Doe",
  "gender": "female",
  "birthdate": "0000-10-31",
  "email": "janedoe@example.com",
  "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
}
```

The above is an ID token, which is meant for **authenticating** the user to the **client**. Note that the audience (aud claim) of the token is set to the client's identifier, which means that only this specific client should consume this token.

The ID token can be thought of as no more than a performance optimization that allows clients to obtain user profile information without making additional network requests after authentication has completed. It should not be used to obtain access to any resources or make authorization decisions.

For comparison, let's look at the contents of an access token that could be returned in the same authentication flow:

```json
{
  "iss": "https://my-domain.auth0.com/",
  "sub": "auth0|123456",
  "aud": [
    "https://example.com/health-api",
    "https://my-domain.auth0.com/userinfo"
  ],
  "azp": "my_client_id",
  "exp": 1311281970,
  "iat": 1311280970,
  "scope": "openid profile read:patients read:admin"
}
```

This token is meant for **authorizing** the user to the **resource server** (API). As such, it is **completely opaque to clients**, meaning that clients should not care about the contents of this token. Note that the token does not contain any information about the user itself besides their ID (`sub` claim), it only contains authorization information about which actions the client is allowed to perform at the API (scope). Since in many cases it's desirable to retrieve additional user information, this token is also valid for calling the [/userinfo API](/api/authentication#get-user-info) (provided that the API for which the `access_token` is issued, uses `RS256` as signing algorithm), which will return the user's profile information.

[Note that the `scope` parameter has a different behavior than in the legacy pipeline](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/scope-custom-claims). It determines the permissions that an authorized client should have for a given resource server (OAuth authorization), as well as which standard profile claims should be included in the ID token (OIDC authentication), given that the user consents to providing that information to the client.

If you have multiple client applications calling one API under a single
client ID, these should be broken up into individual clients and a
resource server to represent the API that these applications depend on.

If you use delegation to exchange tokens obtained by one client into tokens for a different client, this should be replaced by multiple clients authenticating to the same resource server.

If your applications do not depend on external APIs and just need to authenticate users, it is not necessary to define any resource server as long as ID tokens are only processed by clients and not sent to external services.
