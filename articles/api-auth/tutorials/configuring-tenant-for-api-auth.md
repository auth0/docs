# Configuring your tenant for the new API Authorization flows
<%=include('../_region-support') %>

If you want to unlock the new API Authorization scenario, you will need to enable a flag under your [Account Settings](${manage_url}/#/account/advanced). This will allow you to opt-in and out of this feature at any point in time while it remains under preview.

1. Open the Management Dashboard and browse to your Account Settings.
1. Scroll down to the Settings tab and turn on the flag "OAuth2 as a Service (Preview)"

You will see that the API section is now displayed on your sidebar.
