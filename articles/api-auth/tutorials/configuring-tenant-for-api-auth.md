# Configure your tenant for the new API Authorization flows

If you want to unlock the new API Authorization scenario, you will need to enable a flag under your [Account Settings](${manage_url}/#/account/advanced). This will allow you to opt-in and out of this feature at any point in time while it remains under preview.

1. Open the Management Dashboard and browse to your [Account Settings](${manage_url}/#/account/advanced).
1. Click on the _Advanced_ tab, scroll down to the _Settings_ section and turn on the flag __OAuth 2.0 API Authorization__.

You will now see that the API section is displayed on your sidebar.

**NOTE**: For docs on the new API Authorization flows refer to [API Authorization](/api-auth).
