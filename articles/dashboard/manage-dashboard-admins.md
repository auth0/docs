Tenant Administrators can be added and removed from the dashboard, by going to **Tenant Settings** and choosing the [Dashboard Admins](${manage_url}/#/tenant/admins) tab.

To add an Admin, enter the email of the account and then select the applications you would like this user to have admin access to in the **Application** box. Then click the **ADD** button. Admins can be removed by clicking the **REMOVE** button after they have been added.

The MFA indicator will indicate whether an Admin has enabled their account for [Multifactor Authentication](/multifactor-authentication), which they can do in their [Account Settings](/dashboard-account-settings#multifactor).
