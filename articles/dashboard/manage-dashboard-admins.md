To add an Admin, enter the email of the account and then select the applications you would like this user to have admin access to in the **Application** box. Then click the **ADD** button. Admins can be removed by clicking the **REMOVE** button after they have been added.

The MFA indicator will indicate whether an Admin has enabled their account for [Multifactor Authentication](/multifactor-authentication), which they can do in their Account Settings.

## Enrolling in Multifactor Authentication

The admin can self-enroll for multifactor authentication. To begin, they should click on their user name in the top right and going to **View Profile** in the dropdown menu.

Click **Enroll your device now.**
