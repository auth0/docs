Once the new ${application_type} Application is created, you will be redirected to the Application's settings. Available tabs include:

* **Settings**: Shows all available [settings](/dashboard/reference/settings-application#advanced-settings) for your application. By default, most of the settings will be created for you.
* **Quick Start**: Shows all the available examples for ${application_type} applications.
* **Add-ons**: Allows you to enable [Add-ons](/addons) for your Application. Add-ons are extensions and usually are third-party APIs used with Applications for which Auth0 generates Access Tokens.
* **Connections**: Allows you to enable [Connections](/connections) for your Application. Connections are sources of users; they can be enabled and shared between multiple Applications.
