# Set Up Add-ons

This guide will show you how to set up an [add-on](/addons) for an application using Auth0's Dashboard.

1. Navigate to the [Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications) page in the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}/), and click the name of the Application to view.

Each integration is different and requires different parameters and configuration. Once the add-on is activated, you will see tailored instructions with details on how to integrate with it.
