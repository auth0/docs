# Application Settings

In the [Application](${manage_url}/#/applications) section, locate your Application, and click on its *Settings* to review the available settings.

## Basic Settings

![Application Settings Page](/media/articles/applications/settings.png)

- **Name**: The name of your application. Editable, and will be seen in the portal, emails, logs, and so on.

- **Domain**: Your Auth0 tenant name. You choose this when you create a new Auth0 tenant, and it cannot be changed. If you need a different domain, you must register for a new tenant by selecting **+ Create Tenant** in the top-right menu.

- **Client ID**: The unique identifier for your application. You will use this when configuring authentication with Auth0. Generated by the system when you create a new application and cannot be modified.

- **Client Secret**: A string used to sign and validate ID Tokens for authentication flows and to gain access to select Auth0 API endpoints. By default, the value is hidden, so check the **Reveal Client Secret** box to see it.

::: warning
While the Client ID is considered public information, the Client Secret **must be kept confidential**. If anyone can access your Client Secret, they can issue tokens and access resources they shouldn't be able to access.
:::

- **Description**: A free-text description of the Application's purpose. Maximum of 140 characters.

- **Application Logo**: The URL to a logo (recommended size: 150x150 pixels) to be displayed for the application. Appears in several areas, including the list of applications in the Dashboard and customized consent forms.

- **Application Type**: The [Auth0 application type](/applications/concepts/app-types-auth0). Determines which settings you can configure using the Dashboard. Not editable for M2M Apps.

- **Token Endpoint Authentication Method**: Defines the requested authentication method for the token endpoint. Possible values are `None` (public client without a client secret), `Post` (client uses HTTP POST parameters), and `Basic` (client uses HTTP Basic). Only editable for Regular Web Apps and M2M Apps.

::: note
You can provide up to 100 URLs in the **Allowed Callback URLs**, **Allowed Web Origins**, **Allowed Logout URLs**, **Allowed Origins (CORS)** fields.
:::

- **Allowed Callback URLs**: Set of URLs to which Auth0 is allowed to redirect users after they authenticate. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them (typically, to handle different environments like QA or testing). For production environments, verify that the URLs do not point to localhost. You can use the star symbol as a wildcard for subdomains (`*.google.com`). Make sure to specify the protocol, `http://` or `https://`; otherwise, the callback may fail in some cases.

- **Application Login URI**: In some scenarios Auth0 will need your application to start the OIDC login flow. This URI should point to a route in your application that starts the flow, by redirecting to the `/authorize` endpoint. It would usually take the form of 'https://myapp.org/login'. [Learn more](/universal-login/default-login-url).

- **Allowed Web Origins**: List of URLs from where an authorization request using [`web_message` as the response mode](/protocols/oauth2#how-response-mode-works) can originate from. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them. For production environments, verify that the URLs do not point to localhost.

- **Allowed Logout URLs**: List of URLs to which you can redirect users after they log out from Auth0. Use the `returnTo` query parameter to redirect them. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them.  For production environments, verify that the URLs do not point to localhost. You can use the star symbol as a wildcard for subdomains (`*.google.com`). Querystrings and hash information are not taken into account when validating these URLs. For more info, see [Logout](/logout).

- **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: Set of URLs that will be allowed to make requests from JavaScript to Auth0 API (typically used with CORS). This prevents same-origin policy errors when using Auth0 from within a web browser. By default, all your callback URLs will be allowed; this field allows you to enter other origins if you need to. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them. For production environments, verify that the URLs do not point to localhost. You can use the star symbol as a wildcard for subdomains (`*.google.com`). Paths, querystrings, and hash information are not taken into account when validating these URLs (and may, in fact, cause the match to fail).

- **JWT Expiration (seconds)**: The amount of time (in seconds) before the Auth0 ID Token expires. The default value is `36000`, which maps to 10 hours.

- **Use Auth0 instead of the IdP to do Single Sign On**: If enabled, this setting prevents Auth0 from redirecting authenticated users with valid sessions to the identity provider (such as Facebook or ADFS).

## Advanced Settings

The **Advanced Settings** section allows you to:

* Manage or add Application Metadata, Mobile, OAuth, and WS-Federation settings 
* Obtain certificates and token endpoint information
* Set the grant type(s) for the Application

![Advanced Application Settings Page](/media/articles/applications/advanced-settings.png)

### Application Metadata

Application metadata are custom string keys and values (each of which has a character maximum of 255), set on a per application basis. Metadata is exposed in the Application object as client_metadata, and in Rules as context.clientMetadata.

You can create up to 10 sets of metadata.

### Mobile Settings

If you're developing a mobile application, you can provide the necessary iOS/Android parameters here.

When developing iOS apps, you'll provide your **Team ID** and **App Bundle Identifier**.

When developing Android apps, you'll provide your **App Package Name** and your **Key Hashes**.

### OAuth

Set the OAuth-related settings on this tab:

* By default, all apps/APIs can make a delegation request, but if you want to explicitly grant permissions to selected apps/APIs, you can do so in **Allowed APPs/APIs**.

* Set the algorithm used (**HS256** or **RS256**) for signing your JSON Web Tokens. For more info, see [Signing Algorithms](/applications/concepts/signing-algorithms).

* Toggle the **Trust Token Endpoint IP Header** setting; if this is enabled, the `auth0-forwarded-for` is set as trusted and used as a source of end user IP information for protection against brute-force attacks on the token endpoint. This setting is only available for Regular Web Apps and M2M Apps.

* Toggle the switch to indicate if your application is **OIDC Conformant** or not. Applications flagged as OIDC Conformant will strictly follow the OIDC specification. 

* Set the location URL for **Cross-Origin Verification Fallback**. This is the location of the page that will be rendered inside an iframe to perform the token verification when third-party cookies are not enabled in the browser. Must be in the same domain where the embedded login form is hosted and must have an `https` scheme.

### Grant Types

Select grant types to enable or disable for your application. Available grant types are based on the application type.

### WS-Federation

Manage or add WS-Federation settings.

### Certificates

Manage or add the signing certificate, and its fingerprint and thumbprint.

### Endpoints

View endpoint information for OAuth, SAML, and WS-Fed.
