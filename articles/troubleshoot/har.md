# Troubleshooting with HAR files

An [HTTP Archive (HAR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.har) is a JSON formatted log of a web browser's interactions with a web server. If authentication isn't working as expected, you can generate and analyze HAR files to find issues. Including a HAR file in your [support requests](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}) can help speed up the troubleshooting process.

::: warning
HAR files may contain sensitive data such as cookies, passwords, or client secrets. Obfuscate any sensitive data (using a text editor) before sending HAR files to support.

## Generate a HAR file

### Firefox

1. Visit the page and complete the steps that trigger the issue.
1. When complete, go back to the __Network__ tab, right click and then select **Save All As Har**.
1. Before sending the HAR file to us, make sure to obfuscate any sensitive information using a text editor (such as removing passwords, client secrets, and so on).

### Google Chrome

1. Close all __incognito__ windows in Google Chrome.
1. Open a __new incognito__ window in Google Chrome.
1. Go to __Developers Tools > Network__.

### Safari

1. Close all __private__ windows in Safari.
1. Open a __new private__ window in Safari.
1. Go to __Developer > Inspector > Network__

1. Visit the page and complete the steps that trigger the issue.
1. When complete, go back to the __Network__ tab, click __Export__ and save the HAR file.
1. Before sending the HAR file to us, make sure to obfuscate any sensitive information using a text editor (such as removing passwords, client secrets, and so on).

## Analyze a HAR file

To view the HAR file, you can use a tool such as [Google's HAR Analyzer](https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/har_analyzer/). Analyze the list of web requests captured in the HAR file. In particular, check the sequence of redirects to see how far you get in the authentication process. This helps identify where the issue is happening. Compare the sequence of redirects to the expected sequence for your authentication flow.

For example:

* There should be a call to the `/authorize` endpoint to start the authentication flow.
* There may be redirects to remote identity providers to prompt the user to log in.
* Then there should be a redirect back to Auth0 `/login/callback` (`https://login.auth0.com/login/callback`).
* Then there should be a redirect back to your applicationâ€™s callback URL.
