# Verify Rules

Failures in a rule can often cause authentication issues. Perform the following checks to see if rules could be behind your issue.

* Turn rules off and see if the issue still occurs.
* Check that your rules catch all possible errors that might be returned. Uncaught errors could cause failures.
* Check that your rules are calling the `callback` function only once for each logical branch in your code.
* Add `console.log()` statements to your rules to debug and check state. For example: `console.log(“output = “ + some_variable);`.
* Click **Debug Rule** in the Dashboard to view the output from your `console.log` statements.
* View the output in the Real-time Webtask Logs to get more information about your rules’ execution.
