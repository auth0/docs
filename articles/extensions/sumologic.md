# Auth0 Logs to Sumo Logic

The _Auth0 Logs to Sumo Logic_ is a scheduled job that takes all of your Auth0 logs and exports them to [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/).

## Configuring the Extension

To install and configure this extension, click on the _Auth0 Logs to Sumo Logic_ box in the list of provided extensions on the [Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions) page of the [Management Portal](${manage_url}). The _Install Extension_ window pops open.

At this point you should set the following configuration variables:

- **Schedule**: The frequency with which logs should be exported. The schedule can be customized even further after creation.
- **BATCH_SIZE**: The ammount of logs to be read on each execution. Maximun is 100.
- **SUMOLOGIC_URL**: Your Sumo Logic HTTP Collector Endpoint.
- **LOG_LEVEL**: The minimal log level of events that you would like sent to Sumo Logic.
- **LOG_TYPES**: The events for which logs should be exported.

Once you have provided this information, click the *Install* button to finish installing the extension.

## Auth0 Dashboard

Here, at Auth0, we have been using the Auth0 to Sumo Logic extension ourselves since it was first released, and it's proven to be very useful for staying on top of what's happening with our own Auth0 accounts and our internal users. Sumo Logic makes it easy to see the latest failed logins, find and alert on error messages, create charts to visualize trends, or even do complex statistical analysis on your data.

To help us (and our customers) visualize these logs, we spent some time creating a dashboard. The Sumo Logic for Auth0 dashboard shows you the output of several saved searches all on one easy to read screen, and makes it easy to zoom in or drill down when something looks interesting.

If you're a Sumo Logic customer and are interested in trying out this dashboard, just let us know via [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/) and we will gladly share it with you. Make sure to include your Sumo Logic account name in your request. Once it's available through your account, you're free to customize it, add to it, create alerts based on the searches, or really anything else that you find useful.

Have fun analyzing and visualizing those logs!
