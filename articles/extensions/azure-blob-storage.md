# Auth0 Logs to Azure Blob Storage

The *Auth0 Logs to Azure Blob Storage* is a scheduled job that takes all of your Auth0 logs and exports them to Azure Blob Storage.

Azure Blob storage is a service that stores unstructured object data, such as text or binary data, in the cloud as objects/blobs.

## Configure the Extension

To install and configure this extension, navigate to the [Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions) page and click on the __Auth0 Logs to Azure Blob Storage__ box in the list of provided extensions.

The __Install Extension__ window pops open.

At this point you should set the following configuration variables:

- __Schedule__: The frequency with which logs should be exported.
- __Batch_Size__: The amount of logs to be read on each execution. Maximum is 100.
- __Storage_Account_Name__: The name of the Azure storage account you want to export to.
- __Storage_Account_Key__: The access key associated with your storage account.
- __Storage_Container_Name__: The name of the specific container within the storage account you would like to use.

Once you have provided this information, click the *Install* button to finish installing the extension.

## Retrieve the required information from Azure Portal

We need the following information: Account Name, Account Key, and Container Name. Let's see how we can retrieve these values from Azure Portal.

We assume that you have an Azure account. If you donâ€™t have one, you can go to [Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/) and sign up.

Log into your Azure account and click on __Storage accounts__ on the left-hand side. Either select your storage account, or create a new one.

The __Account Name__ is the name of your storage account, the one we created is named `azureauth0logs`.

This value should be set as __Storage_Account_Name__.

To retrieve the rest of the information, click on the Storage account name. The __Overview__ tab is displayed. Click on the __Containers__ tab.

You can create a new container or use an existing one. The one we created is named `auth0`.

This value should be set as __Storage_Container_Name__.

Click on the __Access keys__ tab. Here you can find the value for __Storage_Account_Key__. Use either one of the keys.

Now that you have retrieved all three values head back to the [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}) and set them at the corresponding fields. You 're done!
