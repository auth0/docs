# Authorization Extension: API Access

Once configured and set up, your extension should contain users, as well as groups, roles, and permissions. You can automate provisioning and query the authorization context of your users in real-time if you enable API access to your extension.

## Enable API Access

Log in to the Management Dashboard, and open up the [Authorization Extension](${manage_url}/#/extensions).

To get to **API** section, click on your Auth0 tenant name on the top right of the **Authorization Dashboard**. Click **API**.

On the **Settings** page, use the toggle to enable API Access.

Once enabled, you'll be able to see or control (within the extension) some of the parameters of the tokens issued by the API. You can control the **time to expiration** of the token, as well as view the token's **audience**, **issuer**, and **URL** to access the API.

## Access the Extension's API

When you enabled API access to the extension, Auth0 automatically created an API for your use in the [Dashboard]({$manage_url}/#/apis). To access the API, you'll need to create a Non Interactive Client, which is the entity that interacts with the API itself.

### Create the Client

In the [Clients section of the Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/clients), click **Create Client**. Name your new Client, and choose the **Non Interactive Client** type. Click **Create** to proceed.

You'll be redirected to the **Quick Start** page of the Client, where you can customize the living documentation based on the API with which you'll use the Client. Select the API that Auth0 created for your extension (it should be called **auth0-authorization-extension-api** or similar).

Since this is the first time you're working with the API and Client together, you'll see a message that says, "This client is not authorized for this API." To authorize the client for use with the API, click **Navigate to the API and Authorize**.

You'll see a list of Non Interactive Clients you can use with your API. Click the slider next to the Client you just created to authorize it.

Once you've authorized the Client, you'll see the **Grant ID**. You can also select the **Scopes** to be granted to the Client. The scopes you grant depends on the endpoints you want to access. For example, you'd grant `read:users` to [get all users](hapi/authorization-extension#get-all-users).

If you make any changes to the scopes, click **Update** to save.

### Get the Access Token

To access the API, you'll need to [ask for and obtain the appropriate token](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/client-credentials#ask-for-a-token).

### Call the API

You can call the API via:

* An HTTML request
* A cURL command

You can also find detailed information about the endpoints, as well as samples on how to call each endpoint using the three methods above, in the [Authorization Extension API Explorer](/api/authorization-extension).

You can also refer to the **API Explorer**, which documents everything you can do via command line once you've enabled access to your extension via API.

Click over to the **Explorer** page for the API documentation.
