# Authorization Extension

The Authorization Extension provides support for user authorization via Groups, Roles, and Permissions. You can define the expected behavior during the login process, and your configuration settings will be captured in a [rule](/rules) that's executed during runtime.

You can store authorization data like groups, roles, or permissions in the outgoing token issued by Auth0. Your application can then consume this information by inspecting the token and take appropriate actions based on the user's current authorization context.

## Get Started

Before you can use the extension, you'll need to install it, configure the rule controlling its behavior during login, and set up your user management.
