# User Import / Export

::: note
The User Import / Export extension is available in the PSaaS Appliance beginning with version `10755` when you have user search enabled.
:::

The **User Import / Export Extension** allows you to:

* Bulk import your existing database users into Auth0
* Search for and export some (or all) of your Auth0 database users

You must be a Dashboard Admin to use this extension.

## Install the Extension

To install this extension, click on **User Import / Export** in the list of provided extensions on the [Extensions page](${manage_url}/#/extensions) of the [Dashboard](${manage_url}). 

The extension does not require any additional configuration before it can be installed, so click **Install** in the informational pop-up window to proceed.

You'll be asked to grant permission for the extension to access your Auth0 account for the listed activities the first time you launch the extension.

Click the **check mark** to proceed.

There are two ways of using this extension:

* Bulk import your existing database users into Auth0
* Search for and export some (or all) of you Auth0 database users

Both use cases are explained in further detail below.

### Import Users

By default, any time you open the extension, you'll see the **User Import** screen (if you're on the export screen, you can return to this screen by click **Import** in the left-hand navigation bar).

To import your users, drag and drop a valid JSON file ([schema and examples here](/tutorials/bulk-importing-users-into-auth0)) onto the area that says **Drop your file here, or click to select**. Alternatively, you can click on this area to browse your files and select the appropriate JSON file. The JSON file should contain the list of users that you are planning to import.

Select the database connection for which your users will be imported. Please make sure that the connection you choose has been enabled for at least one application.

Click **Start Importing Users** to begin the import process.

When done, you'll see the following **Completed** message.

Once you've imported your users, you can manage them individually using the [Users section of the Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/users)

### Export Users

To export your existing Auth0 users associated with database connections, select **Export** in the left-hand navigation bar.

You can query the users that you want to export using [Lucene query syntax](http://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html) in the search bar. For example, to return all the users that have the `nickname` attribute you can use: `_exists_:nickname`.

Under **Columns**, you can decide which user attributes or expressions should be included in the export. The user attribute can be a static value like `user.user_metadata.name`, or it can be a JavaScript expression like `user.user_metadata.name || user.name`. Expressions will be evaluated during the export runtime. The **column name** value is how the value will be represented in the export. 

You can use the **Add Default Columns** button to automatically select the default attributes and populate their column names (this is also a good way for you to visualize how parameters/expressions will appear).

You can remove extraneous attributes/expressions by clicking on its associated **trash can** icon.

Under **Settings**, you can:

* Configure how your exported users are listed by providing a **User Attribute** by which users should be sorted (as well as whether the users should be sorted in ascending or descending order)
* Choose your **Export Format**; you can choose between JSON and CSV files

When you're ready, click **Export X Users** (where `X` is the number of users you're exporting).

You can download the file containing your users when the export is complete.
