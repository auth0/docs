# Creating and Installing a Custom Extension

Rather than using one of Auth0's provided extensions, you may choose to create your own.

## Creating a Custom Extension
To begin creating your custom extension, please feel free to fork/clone any one of Auth0's extension repositories:

- [Auth0 Extension Boilerplate](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-extension-boilerplate)
- [Auth0 Extension with API Boilerplate](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-extension-boilerplate-with-api)
- [Auth0 Extension with React Boilerplate](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-extension-boilerplate-with-react)
- [Auth0 Extension with Hooks](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-extension-boilerplate-hooks)

Alternatively, you may follow the _Development Instructions_ provided via the _New Extension_ window that appears when you click on the _+ CREATE EXTENSION_ button. To view the _Development Instructions_, navigate to the [Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions) page of the [Management Portal](${manage_url}). Click on the _+ CREATE EXTENSION_ button. On the popup displayed click on the _Check out this command line tool_ link. The _Development Instructions_ popup is displayed. These instructions allow you to create your own extension using the command line.

Extensions can also be installed using `wt-cli`. The command would look like the following:

```
wt create {file} --name {extensionName} --param owner=“{tenant}” --param version="1.0.0"
```

Once the extension is installed you can make updates using the following:

```
wt update {extensionName} {file} -p {tenant}
```

Learn more about `wt-cli` by visiting the [documentation](https://webtask.io/docs/wt-cli) and the [github repository](https://github.com/auth0/wt-cli).

## Installing a Custom Extension
Once you have created your own extension, you may install it manually via the [Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions) page of the [Auth0 Management Portal](${manage_url}).

Near the top right-hand side of the window, click the _+ CREATE EXTENSION_ button.

In the _New Extension_ window that pops open, provide the GitHub URL to the repository that contains the files required by your extension.

> At this time, only repositories hosted by GitHub may be used.

Alternatively, you may host your files elsewhere and simply provide a link to the `webtask.json` file in the box (e.g. `http://example.com/webtask.json`).

Once you have provided the link to your files and clicked _Continue_, you will be prompted to install the extension. If you would like to proceed, click _Install_.

Under the _Installed Extensions_ tab you will find your newly-installed extension listed.

## Extension Lifecycle

Let's have a look at what happens behind the scenes when installing and uninstalling custom extensions.

When the user clicks on _Install_, a _Client_ and a _ClientGrant_ are created for the extension with the scopes defined on the `webtask.json`. Also, access is granted to Management APIv2 Resource Server.

For this `webtask.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "my-extension";
  "auth0": {
    "createClient": true,
    "scopes": "create:rules"
  }
}
```

The following _Client_ and a _ClientGrant_ would be created:

```javascript
Clients.create({
  name: 'my-extension'
}).then(function (client) {
  return Grants.create({
    audience:  'https://jcenturion.auth0.com/api/v2/',
    client_id: client.client_id,
    scope: "create:rules"
  }).then(function () {
    return addSecrets(wt, client, wtUrl);
  });
});
```

**NOTE**: If you are creating a Cron, then you can omit the `"createClient": true` from the `webtask.json` file. A Client is always created by default for Cron extensions.

The installation dialog will warn the user that the extension will have access to certain scopes. In this case: `create:rules`.

![](/media/articles/extensions/custom/scopes-warning.png)

The webtask will be created with the `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` and `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` information set as secrets.

After the webtask is created, `/.extensions/on-install` (`POST /onInstallUrl`) is called sending a [JWT](/jwt) for validating that Auth0-manage is the one calling it.

> The expected success status is `204`. Keep in mind that if the hooks fail, then the install (or uninstall) will fail as well.

Install and uninstall URLs are configurable through `webtask.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "my-extension";
  "auth0": {
    "scopes": "create:rules",
    "onInstallUrl": "/my-own-on-install" 
  }
}
```

> _onInstallPath_ and _onUninstallPath_ are mandatory if you want auth0-dashboard to call them.

In order to edit an extension `/.extensions/on-update` (`PUT /onUpdateUrl`) is called, with a JWT for validating that Auth0-manage is the one calling it. Once the validation is successful the webtask and the client associated to the webtask are updated with the changes. Again, the expected success status is `204`.

When the user clicks on _Uninstall_, `/.extensions/on-uninstall` (`DELETE /onUninstallUrl`) is called, with a JWT for validating that Auth0-manage is the one calling it. Afterwards, the webtask and the client associated to the webtask are removed.

The JWT, used for authenticating the calls to the hooks for both `/.extensions/on-install` and `/.extensions/on-uninstall`, looks like the following:

```json
{
  aud: {extensionUrl + hookPath},      
  iss: {auth0Domain},                 
  iat: timespan
}
```

The extension should validate the JWT. See [this](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-extension-boilerplate-hooks/blob/master/hooks/index.js#L11) for the validation applied.
