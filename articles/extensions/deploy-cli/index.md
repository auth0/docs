# Deploy CLI Tool

Auth0 supports continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) of Auth0 tenants through our [source control extensions](/extensions#deploy-hosted-pages-rules-and-database-connections-scripts-from-external-repositories) and integration into existing CI/CD pipelines using the Deploy CLI tool.

The Deploy CLI tool (`auth0-deploy-cli`) supports two methods to import and export the following Auth0 tenant configuration objects: 

- Tenant settings
- Rules (including secrets/settings)
- Connections
- Custom databases
- Clients/applications
- Resource servers (APIs)
- Pages
- Email templates and providers
- Guardian settings

You can export the data to a predefined [directory structure](/extensions/deploy-cli/guides/import-export-directory-structure) or a [YAML configuration file](/extensions/deploy-cli/guides/import-export-yaml-file). You can call the tool [programmatically](/extensions/deploy-cli/guides/call-deploy-cli-programmatically). You can also use the tool to replace environment variables. 

::: warning
This tool can be destructive to your Auth0 tenant. Please ensure you have read the documentation and tested the tool on a development tenant before using it in production.
