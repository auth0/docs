# Auth0 Logs to Mixpanel

The Auth0 Logs to Mixpanel is a scheduled job that takes all of your Auth0 logs and exports them to [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com).

## Step 1: Get the required information from Mixpanel

First you need to get some required information from Mixpanel: the Token and API Key that Auth0 will use to connect and push logs.

1. Go to [Mixpanel](https://mixpanel.com)
1. Click on your [Account Settings](https://mixpanel.com/account/)
1. Click on the **Projects** tab
1. Copy the **Token** and **API Key** information. These map respectively to the **MIXPANEL_TOKEN** and **MIXPANEL_KEY** variables that you will set in the next step

Set the following configuration variables:
- **Schedule**: The frequency with which logs should be exported. The schedule can be customized even further after creation.
- **MIXPANEL_TOKEN**: The Mixpanel Token for your mixpanel project to which the Auth0 logs will be exported.
- **MIXPANEL_KEY**: The Mixpanel API Key for your mixpanel project to which the Auth0 logs will be exported.
- **BATCH_SIZE**: The ammount of logs to be read on each execution. Maximun is 20.
- **LOG_LEVEL**: The minimal log level of events that you would like sent to Mixpanel.
- **LOG_TYPES**: The events for which logs should be exported.  If you want you can send only events with a specific type (for example, failed logins).

Once you have provided this information, click the **Install** button to finish installing the extension.

## Use your extension

To view all jobs, navigate to [Dashboard > Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions), click on the **Installed Extensions** link, and select the **Auth0 Logs to Mixpanel** line. There you can see the alls job and failed jobs. You can also view the logs of these runs.
