# Auth0 Extension: Single Sign-On (SSO) Dashboard

The **SSO Dashboard** extension allows you to create a dashboard with multiple enterprise applications that can be enabled for single sign-on for your users for login.

The SSO dashboard supports two types of users: 
**Users**- who will login to the dashboard to then select an application to sign into with SSO. 
**Admins**- can login to configure the applications that are visible to the users. This guide is intended for Dashboard Admins.

## Create an application

Let's start with creating a new application. Navigate to [Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications) and click on the **+Create Application** button. Set a name and choose **Single Page Web Applications** application type. Click on **Create**.

Click on the *Settings* tab and set the **Allowed Callback URLs**. This varies based on your location.

The login URL for **Admins**:

| --- | --- |
| USA | `https://${account.tenant}.us.webtask.io/auth0-sso-dashboard/admins/login` |
| Europe | `https://${account.tenant}.eu.webtask.io/auth0-sso-dashboard/admins/login` |
| Australia | `https://${account.tenant}.au.webtask.io/auth0-sso-dashboard/admins/login` |

The login URL for **Users**:

| Location | Allowed Callback URL |
| --- | --- |
| USA | `https://${account.tenant}.us.webtask.io/auth0-sso-dashboard/login` |
| Europe | `https://${account.tenant}.eu.webtask.io/auth0-sso-dashboard/login` |
| Australia | `https://${account.tenant}.au.webtask.io/auth0-sso-dashboard/login` |

Copy the **Client ID** value.

Save your changes.

### Application connections

By default all the connection types are enabled for users to be able to login into the SSO Dashbboard. If you would like to change this, navigate to the *Connections* tab for the Application.

## Install the extension

We are now ready to setup our new extension. But first, head back to your newly created Application and copy the **Client ID** value.

To install and configure this extension, click on the **SSO Dashboard** box in the list of provided extensions on the [Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions) page of the dashboard. The **Install Extension** window will open.

![Install SSO Dashboard Extension](/media/articles/extensions/sso-dashboard/install-extension.png)

Set the following configuration variables:

- **EXTENSION_CLIENT_ID**: This is the **Client ID** of the application you have created in the [Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications) that you wish to use this extension with.
- **TITLE**: This the custom title that will appear at the top of the SSO Dashboard page.
- **CUSTOM_CSS** *Optional*: This field that can contain a link to custom CSS you can use to style the look of your SSO Dashboard page.

Once you have provided this information, click **INSTALL**.

If you navigate back to the [Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications) view, you will see that there has been an additional application created.

The `auth0-sso-dashboard` application is created automatically when you install the extension. It's an application authorized to access the [Management API](/api/management/v2) and you shouldn't modify it.

## Use the extension

Navigate to the [Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions) page and click on the **Installed Extensions** tab.

Click on the row for the **SSO Dashboard** extension. The first time you click on your installed extension, you will be asked to grant it the required permissions.

Once you agree, you will be directed to your custom **SSO Dashboard** page, which will have the **TITLE** you provided at the top of the page, and if you provided a custom CSS file that styling will be applied.

To login into the dashboard:

For **Admins** use `https://${account.tenant}.<REGION>.webtask.io/auth0-sso-dashboard/admins/login` or through the Dashboard.

For **Users** use `https://${account.tenant}.<REGION>.webtask.io/auth0-sso-dashboard/login`.
