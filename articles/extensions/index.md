# Auth0 Extensions

Auth0 Extensions enable you to install applications (such as [Webtasks](https://webtask.io/)) or run commands/scripts that extend the functionality of the Auth0 base product.

Each extension is separate from all other extensions. Auth0 defines extensions per tenant, so data is stored by the pair `tenant\extension`.

When creating extensions, you have two options:
- [building off of one of Auth0's provided extensions](#using-an-auth0-provided-extension) in the Management Portal;
- [creating and installing your own](#creating-your-own-extension).

## Using an Auth0-Provided Extension

Auth0 provides the following pre-defined extensions, and they are available for installation via the Management Portal. They have not, however, been fully installed. To use one or more of the following apps, you must provide the required configuration information and finish installing the extensions.

- [Auth0 Extension Boilerplate](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-extension-boilerplate)
- [Auth0 Extension with API Boilerplate](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-extension-boilerplate-with-api)
