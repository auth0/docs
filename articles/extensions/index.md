# Auth0 Extensions

Auth0 Extensions enable you to install applications (such as [Webtasks](https://webtask.io/)) or run commands/scripts that extend the functionality of the Auth0 base product.

Each extension is separate from all other extensions. Auth0 defines extensions per tenant, so data is stored by the pair `tenant\extension`.

## Using an Extension

Auth0 provides the following pre-defined extensions, and they are available for installation via the [Dashboard](${manage_url}). To use one or more of the following apps, you must provide the required configuration information and finish installing the extensions.
