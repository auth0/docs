At this point you should set the following configuration variables:
- **Schedule**: The frequency with which logs should be exported. The schedule can be customized even further after creation.
- **BATCH_SIZE**: The ammount of logs to be read on each execution. Maximun is 100.
- **LOGENTRIES_TOKEN**: The Logentries Token for your log set to which the Auth0 logs will be exported.
- **LOG_LEVEL**: The minimal log level of events that you would like sent to Logentries.
- **LOG_TYPES**: The events for which logs should be exported.  If you want you can send only events with a specific type (for example, failed logins).

Once you have provided this information, click the *Install* button to finish installing the extension.
