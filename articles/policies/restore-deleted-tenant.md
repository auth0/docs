# Tenant Restoration Policy

::: note
If you are considering deleting your tenant, please see our [Resetting/Deleting Tenant](/tutorials/delete-reset-tenant) page for alternative options.
:::

As explicitely noted during the tenant deletion process, **deleted tenants cannot be restored** at this time.
