# Tenant Restoration Policy

The following policy governs requests for restoration of Auth0 tenants that were previously deleted.

::: note
If you are considering deleting your tenant, please see our [Resetting/Deleting Tenant](/tutorials/delete-reset-tenant) page for alternative options.
:::

A customer may request a tenant restoration if the tenant was deleted by human error and restoration is critical for the continuity of customer's operations. Please note that before deleting a tenant, from the Auth0 Dashboard, a warning explains that this cannot be undone. However, in some cases we might opt for support this kind of request.

## Considerations

* Tenant restoration cannot be completed for appliance customers.

* Tenant restoration is not supported for customers on a free plan.

* The restoration can take up to seven days.

* Tenant restoration is only possible if the request is made within 20 days from when the tenant was deleted.

## How to request

* Customers must file a tenant restoration request in writing, via the [Auth0 support center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}) or via email.

* Please specify the name that the deleted tenant had and the region where it belonged.

* A member of the Auth0 team will respond your request.
