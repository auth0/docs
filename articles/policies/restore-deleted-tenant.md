# Tenant Restoration Policy

**Before you delete your tenant, please see [Resetting/Deleting Tenant](/tutorials/delete-reset-tenant) page for alternative options.**

**Deleted tenants cannot be restored** and the **tenant name may not be used again** when creating new tenants.

If you've deleted your tenant, and you require the use of a particular domain name, we recommend configuring a [custom domain name](/custom-domains) for your new tenant.
