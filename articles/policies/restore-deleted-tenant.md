# Tenant Restoration Policy

The following policy governs requests for restoration of Auth0 tenants that were previously deleted.

A customer may request a tenant restoration if the tenant was deleted by human error and restoration is critical for the continuity of customer's operations. Please note that before deleting a tenant, from the Auth0 Dashboard, a warning explains that this cannot be undone. However, in some cases we might opt for support this kind of request.

## Considerations:

* We support tenant restoration for all paying customers.

* Tenant restoration is generally not supported for non-paying customers, but we will evaluate the requests on a case-by-case basis. This means that tenant restoration is not guaranteed in this case.

* The restoration can take up to seven days, for paying customers. For non paying customers, it can take longer and it will be specified if the request is accepted.

## How to request:

* Only a dashboard admin of the deleted tenant can request the restoration.

* Customers must file a tenant restoration request in writing, via the [Auth0 support center](https://support.auth0.com) or via email.

* Please specify the name that the deleted tenant had and the region where it belonged.

* A member of the Auth0 team will respond your request.
