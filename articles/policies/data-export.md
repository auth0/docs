# Data Export Policy

If you would like to export your data from Auth0 there are a several ways you can do this. 

## Use the Import/Export Extension

You can use our [Import/Export Extension](/extensions/user-import-export) to export nearly all data in your Auth0 tenant. 

## Use the Management API

If you want to export certain sets of data programmatically, the **Management API** can assist you with this. For more information on using the Management API, you can:

* Browse the [Management API documentation](/api/management/v2)
* Read about [obtaining a token](/api/management/v2/tokens) which you can use to call the Management API
* Read about [searching for users](/api/management/v2/user-search) as well as the [query syntax](/api/management/v2/query-string-syntax) that can be used
