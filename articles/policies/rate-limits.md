# Auth0 API Rate Limit Policy

To ensure the quality of Auth0's services, the Auth0 APIs are subject to rate limiting.

::: note
If you are looking for information on the rate limits on user logins, refer to [Rate Limits on User/Password Authentication](/connections/database/rate-limits).
:::

## Limits

Depending on the API endpoint, the request limit and the rate limit window in which the request limit resets, varies.

Each endpoint is configured with a bucket that defines:

-  the request limit, and
-  the rate limit window (per second, per minute, per hour, etc.)

```text
bucket:
    size: x
    per_minute: y
```

For example, the above states that, for the given bucket, there is a maximum request limit of `x` per minute, and for each minute that elapses, permissions for `y` requests are added back. In other words, for each `60 / y` seconds, one additional request is added to the bucket. This occurs automatically until the bucket contains the maximum permitted number of requests.

::: warning
For some API endpoints, the rate limits are defined per bucket, so the origins of the call do not influence the rate limit changes. For other buckets, the rate limits are defined using different keys, so the originating IP address is considered when counting the number of received API calls.
:::

## Exceeding the Rate Limit

If you exceed the provided rate limit for a given API endpoint, you will receive the [429 Too Many Requests](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4) response with the following message:

```text
{
    "message": "Too many requests. Check the X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining and X-RateLimit-Reset headers."
}
```

Actions such as rapidly updating configuration settings, aggressive polling, or making highy concurrent API calls may result in your app being rate limited.

If your app triggers the rate limit, please refrain from making additional requests until the appropriate amount of time has elapsed.

## HTTP Response Headers

API requests to selected [Authentication](/api/authentication) or [Management API](/api/management/v2) endpoints will return HTTP Response Headers that provide relevant data on where you are at for a given rate limit. If you receive a rate limit-related response header, it will include numeric information detailing your status.

* **X-RateLimit-Limit**: Request limit
* **X-RateLimit-Remaining**: Requests available for the current time frame
* **X-RateLimit-Reset**: Time until the rate limit resets (in UTC [epoch seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time))

## Endpoints with Rate Limits

::: note
If you are using an API endpoint **not** listed below and you receive rate limit headers as part of your response, please see the page on [Anomaly Detection](/anomaly-detection) for additional information.
:::

### Management API v2

The rate limits for this API defer depending on whether your domain is free or paid, production or not.

::: note
- The domains that have no credit card associated in the [Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/tenant/billing/payment) are free.
- To set an environment for your domain (development, staging or production), go to [Support Center > Domains](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}/tenants/public), find your domain, select __Assign Environment Tag__, set the environment and save changes.
:::

The following rate limits apply:

- For all __free domains__, usage of the Management API is restricted to 2 requests per second (and bursts up to 10 requests). This policy goes into effect on __Tuesday, September 12 at 1PM PT__.
- For __non-production domains__ of enterprise customers, usage of the Management API is restricted to 2 requests per second (and bursts up to 10 requests). This policy goes into effect on __Tuesday, September 19 at 1PM PT__.
- For __paid__ domains, usage of the Management API is restricted to 50 requests per second.

The aforementioned rate limits include calls made via [Rules](/rules).

Note, that the limit is set by domain and not by endpoint, and that it does not apply to [Private Instance deployments](/appliance).

The following Auth0 Management API endpoints return rate limit-related headers. For additional information about these endpoints, please consult the [Management API explorer](/api/management/v2).
