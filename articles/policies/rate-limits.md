# Auth0 API Rate Limit Policy

To ensure the quality of Auth0's services, the Auth0 APIs are subject to rate limiting.

::: note
If you are looking for information on the rate limits on user logins, refer to [Rate Limits on User/Password Authentication](/connections/database/rate-limits).
:::

## Limits

Depending on the API endpoint, the request limit and the rate limit window in which the request limit resets, varies.

Each endpoint is configured with a bucket that defines:

-  the request limit, and
-  the rate limit window (per second, per minute, per hour, and so on)

```text
bucket:
    size: x
    per_minute: y
```

For example, the above states that, for the given bucket, there is a maximum request limit of `x` per minute, and for each minute that elapses, permissions for `y` requests are added back. In other words, for each `60 / y` seconds, one additional request is added to the bucket. This occurs automatically until the bucket contains the maximum permitted number of requests.

::: warning
For some API endpoints, the rate limits are defined per bucket, so the origins of the call do not influence the rate limit changes. For other buckets, the rate limits are defined using different keys, so the originating IP address is considered when counting the number of received API calls.
:::

## Exceeding the Rate Limit

If you exceed the provided rate limit for a given API endpoint, you will receive a response with [HTTP Status Code 429 (Too Many Requests)](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585#section-4). You can refer to the [HTTP Response Headers](#http-response-headers) for more information on the rate limits applicable to that endpoint.

Actions such as rapidly updating configuration settings, aggressive polling, or making highy concurrent API calls may result in your app being rate limited.

If your app triggers the rate limit, please refrain from making additional requests until the appropriate amount of time has elapsed.

## HTTP Response Headers

API requests to selected [Authentication](/api/authentication) or [Management API](/api/management/v2) endpoints will return HTTP Response Headers that provide relevant data on the current status of your rate limits for that endpoint. If you receive a rate limit-related response header, it will include numeric information detailing your status.

* **X-RateLimit-Limit**: The maximum number of requests available in the current time frame.
* **X-RateLimit-Remaining**: The number of remaining requests in the current time frame.
* **X-RateLimit-Reset**: A [UNIX timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) of the expected time when the rate limit will reset.

## Endpoints with Rate Limits

::: note
If you are using an API endpoint **not** listed below and you receive rate limit headers as part of your response, please see the page on [Anomaly Detection](/anomaly-detection) for additional information.
:::

### Management API v2

The rate limits for this API defer depending on whether your tenant is free or paid, production or not.

::: note
- The tenants that have no credit card associated in the [Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/tenant/billing/payment) are free.
- To set an environment for your tenant (development, staging or production), go to [Support Center > Tenants](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}/tenants/public), find your tenant, select __Assign Environment Tag__, set the environment and save changes.
:::

The following rate limits apply:

- For all __free tenants__, usage of the Management API is restricted to 2 requests per second (and bursts up to 10 requests). This policy goes into effect on __Tuesday, September 12 at 1PM PT__.
- For __non-production tenants__ of enterprise customers, usage of the Management API is restricted to 2 requests per second (and bursts up to 10 requests). This policy goes into effect on __Tuesday, September 19 at 1PM PT__.
- For __paid__ tenants, usage of the Management API is restricted to 50 requests per second.

The aforementioned rate limits include calls made via [Rules](/rules).

Note, that the limit is set by tenant and not by endpoint.

The following Auth0 Management API endpoints return rate limit-related headers. For additional information about these endpoints, please consult the [Management API explorer](/api/management/v2).
