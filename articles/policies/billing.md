# Billing Policy

The following policy governs requests for billing mechanisms within the Auth0 dashboard.

## Change of billing email address

It is possible to change the billing email address, but for security reasons the request should be performed by a Dashboard administrator by filing a new ticket through our [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com). A member of our support team will then contact you in that same ticket with steps on how the request will proceed.
Please note that if you are not a Dashboard administrator, we will not process this request.

### Special case

Please note that the customers who created tenants via the Heroku hosting platform or Azure Marketplace have to change the billing email address (or any other billing details) in those platforms. We cannot edit any billing information if you have used one of those services.

## Why is my credit card failing?
The only way to determine the reason for the failure is for the customer to contact their credit card company by calling the number on the back. This can be triggered by a credit card reaching the limit or simply being rejected by the bank, for example.

### My credit card is failing and some features are not available anymore
If your credit card fails, this will not affect the service. So if you are having issues with the service, it is not due to the credit card failing.

## How can I cancel my subscription?
Please proceed by downgrading your subscription to free or by cancelling your subscription via the Auth0 Dashboard. 

1. Login to the Auth0 management dashboard
2. Click on your username in the top right corner to bring up the associated dropdown box.
3. Select `Account Settings`.
4. On the `Account Settings` page, click on the `Subscription` tab.
5. On the `Subscription` tab, scroll down to the box associated with the `Free plan` and click `Checkout`.
6. To confirm your subscription change, click `Subscribe` Now.
