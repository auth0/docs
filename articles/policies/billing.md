# Billing Policy

The following policy governs requests for billing mechanisms within the Auth0 dashboard.

## Change of billing email address

It is possible to change the billing email address, but for security reasons the request must be performed by a Dashboard administrator. It should file a new ticket in our Support Center. A member of our support team will contact you in that same ticket with steps on how this request will proceed. Please notice that if you are not a Dashboard administrator, we will require that a Dashboard administrator creates this request.
