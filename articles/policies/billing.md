# Billing Policy

The following policy governs requests for billing mechanisms within the Auth0 dashboard.

## Change of billing email address

It is possible to change the billing email address, but for security reasons the request should be performed by a Dashboard administrator by filing a new ticket through our [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com). A member of our support team will then contact you in that same ticket with steps on how the request will proceed. 
Please note that if you are not a Dashboard administrator, we will not process this request.
