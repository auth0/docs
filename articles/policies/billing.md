# Billing Policy

The following policy governs requests for billing mechanisms within the Auth0 dashboard.

## Change of billing email address

It is possible to change the billing email address, but for security reasons the request must be done from a Dashboard administrator. 
The request should be performed by a Dashboard administrator. It should file a new ticket in our Support Center. A member of our support team will contact you in that same ticket with steps on how this request will proceed.

### Special case

Please note that the customers who created tenants via the Heroku hosting platform or Azure Marketplace have to change the billing email address (or any other billing details) in those platforms. We cannot edit any billing information if you have used one of those services.

## Why is my credit card failing?
The only way to determine the reason for the failure is for the customer to contact their credit card company by calling the number on the back. This can be triggered by a credit card reaching the limit or simply being rejected by the bank, for example.

## How can I cancel my subscription?
Please proceed by downgrading your subscription to free or by cancelling your subscription via the Auth0 Dashboard.
