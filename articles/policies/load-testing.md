# Load Testing Policy

Load testing against the Auth0 production cloud service is not permitted at any time, as stated in our [Terms of Service](https://auth0.com/terms).

Customers who have purchased a platinum enterprise support plan that includes load testing may request one load test (with up to 2 repeats) to conduct load testing against an Auth0 test instance.

## How to request

* Customers must file a load testing request in writing, via the [Auth0 support center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}).
* Requests must be filed at least two (2) weeks in advance of the desired test date.
* Requests must be approved in writing before any load/performance testing is conducted.

* Customers must have configured their own email provider within the Auth0 dashboard (Email -> Providers) before a load testing request will be approved.

## Test windows
Approved load testing windows are subject to availability of testing windows on a first-come first-served basis. Customers are encouraged to submit requests well in advance of the 2-week advance notice period.

Testing windows will have a scheduled start and end time assigned by Auth0 and all testing must begin and complete during the window.

It is common for an initial load test to experience some unexpected issues, resulting in a need for repeat tests.  Customers should plan in advance and allow sufficient time for repeat tests before any planned golive.

## Information to include in requests
The load testing request must include the following information:

* A description of the test to be done
* The Auth0 account to be used during the test
* The requested duration of the test (2 hour maximum)
* The Auth0 features, such as rules, email, used during the test
* The Auth0 API endpoints to be used
* The types of Auth0 connections involved in the test
* Which Auth0 Rules, if any, will execute during the test
* Which Custom DB, if any, will be used
* Which Auth0 Webtasks, if any, will be used
* Whether verification, welcome or other emails will be sent
* The peak load, specified in requests-per-second, expected for each API endpoint or Auth0 feature involved in the test.
* An explanation/justification for the peak load numbers.  The justification should include the size of the target user population and realistic estimates of logins per hour to justify TPS numbers.
* The ramp-up rate for the test
* Contacts who will be available during the test and how to reach them

## Test requirements
Note that load testing will require customer to:

* Configure their own email provider in Auth0
* Receive approval from their email provider to send the expected volume of email
* Make arrangements for bounced emails
* Establish a mechanism for testing that emails arrived

## Limitations
Auth0 reserves the right to reject or request modifications to load test plans.

A load testing approval will specify pre-arranged dates/times in which load testing can be performed.  All load testing must be limited to those pre-arranged dates/times. Load testing windows will be a maximum of 2 hours in duration. Failure to abide by this policy may result in temporary blocking of access to an account until the issue is remediated.

## Effectivity
This policy is effective April 4, 2016
