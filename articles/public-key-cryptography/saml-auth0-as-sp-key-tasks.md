## Auth0 as Service Provider (SAML connection)

When you use Auth0 as Service Provider there are some tasks that you may need to perform, with regards to keys:
+ Download public key/certificate for Identity Provider (IDP) to validate the signature.
+ Upload public key/certificate from IDP.
+ Download public key/certificate for IDP  to encrypt assertions, if needed.
+ Upload a custom keypair, private key, or certificate via the Management API.
+ Updating certificates.

::: panel-info More information on Auth0 as a Service Provider
This article describes only those tasks are related to keys and certificates. For detailed information on how to configure Auth0 as a Service Provider, please refer to the document [Auth0 as ServiceProvider](/saml-sp-generic) or watch [this](/saml-configuration#configuring-auth0-as-a-service-provider) video.

### Download public key/certificate for IDP to validate the signature

In order for the IDP to validate the signature of each SAML authentication request sent by Auth0, the public key and the certificate have to be provided.

1. Open the Auth0 dashboard and navigate to __Connections__ > __Enterprise__ > __SAMLP Identity Provider__.
2. Click on the __Settings__ (gear) icon for your SAMLP connection.
3. Turn on the toggle for __Sign Request__.
4. Select the __Sign Request Algorithm__ and the __Sign Request Digest Algorithm__ acceptable to your IDP.

__Note:__ SHA256 should be used, since SHA1 is now considered obsolete and insecure.

5. Set the __Protocol Binding__ to __HTTP-POST__, if your IDP can accept it as signed requests may be too long for use with the HTTP-Redirect Protocol Binding.
6. Download your certificate, using the link in the text below the  Sign Request toggle.
7. Give your certificate to the IDP, for use in validating the signed authentication request.

### Upload public key/certificate from IDP

In order for Auth0 to validate the signed authentication responses coming from the IDP, you have to upload to Auth0 the certificate that your IDP will provide you with. This is done as part of the initial connection setup, but a new certificate can be uploaded at any time.

1. Obtain the certificate from the IDP and if necessary, convert to .pem format.
2. Open the Auth0 dashboard and navigate to __Connections__ > __Enterprise__ > __SAMLP Identity Provider__.
3. Click on the __Settings__ (gear) icon for your SAMLP connection.
4. Use the __UPLOAD CERTIFICATE__ button to upload the certificate file from IDP.

### Download public key/certificate for IDP to encrypt assertions

Optionally, assertions can be encrypted. In order for the IDP to make the relevant configuration your public key will have to be provided. 

1. Open the Auth0 dashboard and navigate to __Connections__ > __Enterprise__ > __SAMLP Identity Provider__.
2. Click on the __Settings__ (gear) icon for your SAMLP connection.
3. Under __Encrypted Assertions__, use the links for CER, PEM or PKCS#7 to download a public key/certificate in the format needed for your IDP.

### Upload a custom keypair, private key, or certificate via the Management API

If you need to load your own private key into Auth0 instead of using the default one generated by Auth0, or you wish to create connections and upload certificates programmatically, you can use the Auth0 Management API. 

There are different attributes used for the following functions, so be sure to use the right attribute:

| Management APIv2 Attribute | Use  |
| -------------------------- | ---- |
| signing_key                | Signing a SAML authNRequest |
| signingCert                | Validating signature on a SAML authN Response |
| decryptionKey              | Decrypting a response/assertion sent encrypted by IDP |

To update via the Management APIv2 explorer:

1. Log into Auth0 dashboard
2. Using the same browser, navigate to [Management APIv2](https://auth0.com/docs/api/v2)
3. Under __SCOPES__, select the __read: connections__, by selecting __connections__ at the __entity__ dropdown, and __read__ at the __actions__ dropdown. Click the arrow pointing to the right to add the scope.

4. Select the __update: connections__, by selecting the __update__ value at the __actions__ dropdown and clicking once more the arrow pointing to the right.

![](media/articles/public-key-cryptography/mgmt-api-scope-update-conn.png)

5. On the __API REFERENCE__ menu on the left, select __Connections__ > __Get all connections__

6. Scroll down to the __Test this endpoint__ section and click the __TRY__ button.

![](media/articles/public-key-cryptography/mgmt-api-get-conn-try.png)

7. The __RESPONSE BODY__ contains all your configured connections. Locate the connection you wish to update and copy the connection ID. This is in the __id__ field and is of the form "**con_**_<alphanumeric>_"

![](media/articles/public-key-cryptography/mgmt-api-get-conn-id.png)

8. On the __API REFERENCE__ menu on the left, select __Connections__ > __Get a connection__

9. At the __Parameters__ section, paste the connection ID you copied earlier at the __id__ field. Click the __TRY__ button.

10. At the __RESPONSE BODY__ there are all the attributes you need for the connection to be updated. Copy the signInEndpoint, signOutEndpoint, signingCert attributes and supply these options along with the signing key and certificate you wish to upload.  If you don't supply them you will get an error.

__Note:__ If you have previously loaded a signing_key attribute or decryptionKey attribute, you will also need to copy those as well or they will be removed.





=========================== PENDING TEXT ================================================================


In the Management APIv2 explorer, use the Update a connection endpoint to update the connection.

Paste the connection ID into the id field.
Paste the following into the “body” field, substituting the values from your connection for signInEndpoint, signOutEndpoint, and signingCert, and substituting the values of your private key for the “decryptionKey” field, signingCert, and signing_key.

The example shows "..." for most of the key/cert fields below for readability - you will have a long line to paste in for each of them.

The "decryptionKey" attribute is the one for the private key used to decrypt assertions that are sent encrypted by IDP.  You need to give the corresponding public key to the IDP for encryption.

The "signingCert" attribute is for the  IdP's public key encoded in PEM or CER format and used to validate the signature on the SAML response from IDP. (the private key is used by the IdP to sign the SAML Response.

The "signing_key" attribute is for the private key used by Auth0 to sign the SAMLRequest (note - this is only used if `connection.options.signSAMLRequest` is `TRUE`, default: `FALSE`)

BODY for Update connection endpoint:

{
"options": {
"signInEndpoint": "https://YOUR-IDP-SSO-URL",
"signOutEndpoint": "https://YOUR-IDP-SLO-URL",
"signingCert": "AB...S0K",
“signSAMLRequest”:true,
"decryptionKey" : "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMII.Mdm\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n" ,

"signing_key" : {
"key":"-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\nMII...dm\n-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\n",

"cert":"-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMI...6O\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----\n"
}
}
}

Note that the key and cert attributes need to be one long concatenated string. When generated by openssl or other programs, the key/cert are typically in a file with multiple lines so you will have to concatenate the lines, putting a “\n” between the lines, and then paste that one long line into the "body", as shown above.
