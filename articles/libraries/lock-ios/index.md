# Lock for iOS and OS X

[Auth0](https://auth0.com) is an authentication broker that supports social identity providers as well as enterprise identity providers such as Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps and Salesforce.

Lock makes it easy to integrate SSO in your app. You won't have to worry about:

* Having a professional looking login dialog that displays well on any device.
* Finding the right icons for popular social providers.
* Solving the home realm discovery challenge with enterprise users (i.e.: asking the enterprise user the email, and redirecting to the right enterprise identity provider).
* Implementing a standard sign in protocol (OpenID Connect / OAuth2 Login)

## Key features

* **Integrates** your iOS app with **Auth0** (OS X coming soon).
* Provides a **beautiful native UI** to log your users in.
* Provides support for **Social Providers** (Facebook, Twitter, etc.), **Enterprise Providers** (AD, LDAP, etc.) and **Username & Password**.
* Provides the ability to do **SSO** with 2 or more mobile apps similar to Facebook and Messenger apps.
* [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) integration using **iOS 8** [Extension](https://github.com/AgileBits/onepassword-app-extension).
* Passwordless authentication using **TouchID** and **SMS**.

## Requierements

iOS 7+. If you need to use our SDK in an earlier version please use our previous SDK pod `Auth0Client` or check the branch [old-sdk](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.iOS-OSX/tree/old-sdk) of this repo.

## Install

The Lock is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

${snippet(meta.snippets.dependencies)}

Then in your project's `Info.plist` file add the following entries:

* __Auth0ClientId__: The client ID of your application in __Auth0__.
* __Auth0Domain__: Your account's domain in __Auth0__.

> You can find these values in your app's settings in [Auth0 dashboard](${uiURL}/#/applications).

For example:

[![Auth0 plist](http://assets.auth0.com/mobile-sdk-lock/example-plist.png)](http://auth0.com)

Also you need to register a Custom URL type, it must have a custom scheme with the following format `a0<Your Client ID>`. For example if your Client ID is `Exe6ccNagokLH7mBmzFejP` then the custom scheme should be `a0Exe6ccNagokLH7mBmzFejP`.

Before you start using Lock, we need to import Lock to your codebase, if you are still working in Objective-C you need to import this header when you need to use Lock's classes:

```objc
#import <Lock/Lock.h>
```

The same applies if you are working in Swift and Lock is included as a static library but the header must be included in your _Objective-C Bridging Header_.

> If you need help creating the Objective-C Bridging Header, please check the [wiki](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/MixandMatch.html)

If you are working in Swift with Lock included as an framework, just include in your swift files the module like this:

```swift
import Lock
```

Now it's time to initialize `A0Lock`, which will help you handle the authentication for you, and keep it in your AppDelegate as a **strong** property. We will create it inside `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:`

> You can store `A0Lock` in another place if you prefer, as long as you keep it alive as long as you need it.

```objc
self.lock = [A0Lock newLock];
```

```swift
self.lock = A0Lock()
```

Then call this method

```objc
[self.lock applicationLaunchedWithOptions:launchOptions];
```

```swift
self.lock.applicationLaunchedWithOptions(launchOptions)
```

Finally you'll need to handle the already registered custom scheme in your AppDelegate, so override `-application:openURL:sourceApplication:annotation:` method and add the following line:

```objc
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application openURL:(NSURL *)url sourceApplication:(NSString *)sourceApplication annotation:(id)annotation {
    return [self.lock handleURL:url sourceApplication:sourceApplication];
}
```
```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, openURL url: NSURL, sourceApplication: String?, annotation: AnyObject?) -> Bool {
    return self.lock.handleURL(url, sourceApplication: sourceApplication)
}
```

> This is required to be able to return back to your application when authenticating with Safari (or native integration with FB or Twitter if used). This call checks the URL and handles all that have the custom scheme defined before.

## Usage

### Email/Password, Enterprise & Social authentication

`A0LockViewController` will handle Email/Password, Enterprise & Social authentication based on your Application's connections enabled in your Auth0's Dashboard.

First instantiate `A0LockViewController` and register the authentication callback that will receive the authenticated user's credentials. Finally present it as a modal view controller:

```objc
A0Lock *lock = ... //Fetch Lock from where its stored
A0LockViewController *controller = [lock newLockViewController];
controller.onAuthenticationBlock = ^(A0UserProfile *profile, A0Token *token) {
    // Do something with token & profile. e.g.: save them.
    // Lock will not save the Token and the profile for you.
    // And dismiss the UIViewController.
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
};
[self presentViewController:controller animated:YES completion:nil];
```
```swift
let lock = ... //Fetch Lock from where its stored
let controller = lock.newLockViewController()
controller.onAuthenticationBlock = {(profile: A0UserProfile!, token: A0Token!) -> () in
    // Do something with token & profile. e.g.: save them.
    // Lock will not save the Token and the profile for you.
    // And dismiss the UIViewController.
    self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
}
self.presentViewController(controller, animated: true, completion: nil)
```
And you'll see our native login screen

> By default all social authentication will be done using Safari, if you want native integration please check this [wiki page](/libraries/lock-ios/native-social-authentication).

Also you can check our [Swift](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.iOS-OSX/tree/master/Examples/basic-sample-swift) and [Objective-C](https://github.com/auth0/Lock.iOS-OSX/tree/master/Examples/basic-sample) example apps. For more information on how to use **Lock** with Swift please check [this guide](/libraries/lock-ios/swift)

### TouchID

`A0TouchIDLockViewController` authenticates without using a password with TouchID. In order to be able to authenticate the user, your application must have a Database connection enabled.

First instantiate `A0TouchIDLockViewController` and register the authentication callback that will receive the authenticated user's credentials. Finally present it to the user:
```objc
A0Lock *lock = ... //Fetch Lock from where its stored
A0TouchIDLockViewController *controller = [lock newTouchIDViewController];
controller.onAuthenticationBlock = ^(A0UserProfile *profile, A0Token *token) {
    // Do something with token & profile. e.g.: save them.
    // Lock will not save the Token and the profile for you.
    // And dismiss the UIViewController.
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
};
[lock presentTouchIDController:controller fromController:self];
```

```swift
let lock = ... //Fetch Lock from where its stored
let controller = lock.newTouchIDViewController()
lock.onAuthenticationBlock = {(profile: A0UserProfile!, token: A0Token!) -> () in
    // Do something with token & profile. e.g.: save them.
    // Lock will not save the Token and the profile for you.
    // And dismiss the UIViewController.
    self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
}
lock.presentTouchIDController(controller, fromController: self)
```
And you'll see TouchID login screen

[![Lock.png](http://blog.auth0.com.s3.amazonaws.com/Lock-TouchID-Screenshot.png)](https://auth0.com)

> Because it uses a Database connection, the user can change it's password and authenticate using email/password whenever needed. For example when you change your device.

### SMS

`A0SMSLockViewController` authenticates without using a password with SMS. In order to be able to authenticate the user, your application must have the SMS connection enabled and configured in your [dashboard](${uiURL}/#/connections/passwordless).

First instantiate `A0SMSLockViewController` and register the authentication callback that will receive the authenticated user's credentials.

The next step is register a block to return an API Token used to register the  phone number and send the login code with SMS. This token can be generated in  [Auth0 API v2 page](/api/v2), just select the scope `create:users` and copy the generated API Token.

Finally present it to the user:
```objc
A0Lock *lock = ... //Fetch Lock from where its stored
A0SMSLockViewController *controller = [lock newSMSViewController];
controller.auth0APIToken = ^{
    return @"Copy API v2 token here";
};
controller.onAuthenticationBlock = ^(A0UserProfile *profile, A0Token *token) {
    // Do something with token & profile. e.g.: save them.
    // Lock will not save the Token and the profile for you.
    // And dismiss the UIViewController.
    [self dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];
};
[lock presentSMSController:controller fromController:self];
```

```swift
let lock = ... //Fetch Lock from where its stored
let controller = lock.newSMSViewController()
lock.auth0APIToken = {() -> String in return "Copy API v2 token here"}
lock.onAuthenticationBlock = {(profile: A0UserProfile!, token: A0Token!) -> () in
    // Do something with token & profile. e.g.: save them.
    // Lock will not save the Token and the profile for you.
    // And dismiss the UIViewController.
    self.dismissViewControllerAnimated(true, completion: nil)
}
lock.presentSMSController(controller, fromController: self)
```
And you'll see SMS login screen

## SSO

A very cool thing you can do with Lock is use SSO. Imagine you want to create 2 apps. However, you want that if the user is logged in in app A, he will be already logged in in app B as well. Something similar to what happens with Messenger and Facebook as well as Foursquare and Swarm.

Read [this guide](/libraries/lock-ios/sso-on-mobile-apps)) to learn how to accomplish this with this library.

## API

### A0Lock

#### A0Lock#newLock

```objc
A0APIClient *client = [lock apiClient];
```

#### A0Lock#newUserAPIClientWithIdToken
```objc

```
Register IdP authenticators that will be used for Social & Enterprise connections. By default all Social & Enterprise authentications are performed by using the web flow with Safari but you can plug your own authenticator for a connection. e.g.: you can register `A0FacebookAuthenticator` in order to login with FB native SDK.
```objc
[lock registerAuthenticators:@[facebook, twitter]];
```

#### A0Lock#applicationLaunchedWithOptions
```objc
- (void)applicationLaunchedWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions;
```
Handle application launched event.
```objc
[lock applicationLaunchedWithOptions:launchOptions];
```

#### A0Lock#clearSessions
```objc
- (void)clearSessions;
```
Remove all stored sessions of any IdP in your application. If the user logged in using Safari, those sessions will not be cleaned.
```objc
[lock clearSessions];
```

### A0LockViewController

#### A0LockViewController#init
```objc
- (instancetype)initWithLock:(A0Lock *)lock;
```
Initialise 'A0LockViewController' using a `A0Lock` instance.
```objc
A0LockViewController *controller = [[A0LockViewController alloc] initWithLock:lock];
```

#### A0LockViewController#onAuthenticationBlock
```objc
@property (copy, nonatomic) void(^onAuthenticationBlock)(A0UserProfile *profile, A0Token *token);
```
Block that is called on successful authentication. It has two parameters profile and token, which will be non-nil unless login is disabled after signup.
```objc
controller.onAuthenticationBlock = ^(A0UserProfile *profile, A0Token *token) {
  NSLog(@"Auth successful: profile %@, token %@", profile, token);
};
```

#### A0LockViewController#onUserDismissBlock
```objc
@property (copy, nonatomic) void(^onUserDismissBlock)();
```
Block that is called on when the user dismisses the Login screen. Only when `closable` property is `YES`.
```objc
controller.onUserDismissBlock = ^() {
  NSLog(@"User dismissed login screen.");
};
```

#### A0LockViewController#usesEmail
```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL usesEmail;
```
Enable the username to be treated as an email (and validated as one too) in all Auth0 screens. Default is `YES`
```objc
controller.usesEmail = NO;
```

#### A0LockViewController#closable
```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL closable;
```
Allows the `A0LockViewController` to be dismissed by adding a button. Default is `NO`
```objc
controller.closable = YES;
```

#### A0LockViewController#loginAfterSignup
```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL loginAfterSignUp;
```
After a successful Signup, `A0LockViewController` will attempt to login the user if this property is `YES` otherwise will call `onAuthenticationBlock` with both parameters nil. Default value is `YES`
```objc
controller.loginAfterSignup = NO;
```

#### A0LockViewController#authenticationParameters
```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) A0AuthParameters *authenticationParameters;
```
List of optional parameters that will be used for every authentication request with Auth0 API. By default it only has  'openid' and 'offline_access' scope values. For more information check out our [Wiki](/libraries/lock-ios/sending-authentication-parameters)
```objc
controller.authenticationParameters.scopes = @[A0ScopeOfflineAccess, A0ScopeProfile];
```

### A0LockViewController#signupDisclaimerView
```objc
@property (strong, nonatomic) UIView *signUpDisclaimerView;
```
View that will appear in the bottom of Signup screen. It should be used to show Terms & Conditions of your app.
```objc
UIView *view = //..
controller.signupDisclaimerView = view;
```
#### A0LockViewController#useWebView
```objc
@property (assign, nonatomic) BOOL useWebView;
```
When the authentication requires to open a web login, for example Linkedin, it will use an embedded UIWebView instead of Safari if it's `YES`. We recommend using Safari for Authentication since it will always save the User session. This means that if he's already signed in, for example in Linkedin, and he clicks in the Linkedin button, it will just work. Default values is `NO`
```objc
controller.useWebView = YES
```
