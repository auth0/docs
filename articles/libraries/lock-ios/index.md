## Overview

Lock is a library that provides widgets for authentication-related tasks. It includes **login dialogs**, **sign up dialogs**, **password recovery mechanisms** and **social connections integrations**. 

Lock works in cooperation with [Auth0](https://auth0.com).

> [Auth0](https://auth0.com) is an authentication broker that supports social identity providers, as well as enterprise identity providers, such as Active Directory, LDAP, Google Apps and Salesforce.

Lock facilitates your client-side authentication development, by providing:

* A professional looking for login and sign up dialogs that displays well on any device.
* Support for social providers (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and enterprise providers (AD, LDAP, etc.).
* A standard sign in protocol (OpenID Connect / OAuth2 Login).
* [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword) integration using [iOS Extension](https://github.com/AgileBits/onepassword-app-extension).
* Passwordless authentication using TouchID**, **Email and SMS.
