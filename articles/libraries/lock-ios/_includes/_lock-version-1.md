This document covers an out-of-date version of Lock for iOS - version 1. We recommend using the latest version of the library. To do so select v2 at the dropdown. If you are already using v1 but interested in upgrading, take a look at the <a href="/libraries/lock-ios/v2/migration">Lock v1 to Lock v2 migration guide</a>.
