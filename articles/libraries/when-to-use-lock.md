# Lock vs. a Custom UI

<%= include('../_includes/_lock_auth0js_deprecations_notice') %>

When adding Auth0 to your web apps, the best solution is to use Auth0's [universal login](/hosted-pages/login). Using universal login is an incredibly simple process, and prevents the dangers of cross-origin authentication. The login page uses the Lock Widget to allow your users to authenticate by default, but also has templates for Lock Passwordless and for a custom UI built with Auth0.js SDK. You can customize the page in the [Hosted Pages Editor](${manage_url}/#/login_page), and use any of the following to implement your authentication needs.

* Lock, Auth0's drop-in login and signup widget
  * [Lock for Web](/libraries/lock)
  * [Lock for iOS](/libraries/lock-ios)
  * [Lock for Android](/libraries/lock-android)
* One of our libraries (along with a custom interface)
  * [Auth0 SDK for Web](/libraries/auth0js)
  * [Auth0 SDK for iOS](/libraries/auth0-swift)
  * [Auth0 SDK for Android](/libraries/auth0-android)
* Or, a custom user interface that you have created directly tying into the [Authentication API](/auth-api).

If universal login doesn't work for you, all of the above can be embedded in your own application and used in that way, as well.  

::: note
Passwordless authentication from native mobile apps currently must use universal login - there is no native passwordless option at this time.

## When to Implement Lock vs. a Custom UI

**Lock** is a drop-in authentication widget that provides a standard set of behaviors and a customizable user interface.  

**Auth0 SDKs** are client-side libraries that **do not** come with a user interface but allow for expanded customization of the behavior and appearance of the login page.

The **Authentication API** provides integration without requiring the use of Auth0 SDKs. The best option to choose will depend on the needs of your app.

Below is a quick overview of reasons you might want to use Lock, versus using an Auth0 SDK or the authentication API. There are details about each option (Lock, Auth0 SDKs, Authentication API) below the table, to assist you in finding the right way to implement Auth0 in your application!

## Lock

**Lock** is an embeddable login form that makes it easy for your users to authenticate using a selected connection. **Lock** will automatically handle most of the details involved in creating and authenticating users. Lock is provided as a drop-in solution for [Web](/libraries/lock), as well as for native [iOS](/libraries/lock-ios) or [Android](/libraries/lock-android) apps.

![](/media/articles/libraries/lock/lock-default.png)

With **Lock**, you will be implementing a UI that:

* Is robust and provides an excellent user experience on any device with any resolution
* Has a simple design that fits in with most websites with just a few tweaks to its custom color
* Adapts to your configuration, displaying the appropriate form controls for each available connection and only those which are allowed (such as sign up or password reset)
* Selects the correct connection automatically. You may specify a desired default behavior for ambiguous cases
* Remembers the last used connection for a given user
* Automatically accommodates internationalization
* Provides instant password policy checking at sign up

Although you cannot alter Lock's behavior, you can configure several [basic options](/libraries/lock/customization) to make Lock look and behave differently.

### When to use Lock

Consider using **Lock** if:

* You like structure, look, and feel of **Lock**
* You prefer a quicker and easier implementation of Auth0 and a ready-made responsive UI
* Your process includes many of the use cases that **Lock** handles out of the box:
  * Enterprise logins
  * Databases with password policies
  * User signup and password reset
  * Authentication using social providers
  * Avatars
* You want a login form that can be reused in multiple areas

## Custom User Interface

If the requirements of your app cannot be met by the standardized behavior of **Lock**, or if you have a complex custom authentication process, a custom user interface is needed. You also might prefer this option if you already have a user interface which you would prefer to keep.

With Auth0's library for [Web](/libraries/auth0js), or with native libraries for [iOS](/libraries/auth0-swift) or [Android](/libraries/auth0-android), you can customize the behavior and flow of the process used to trigger signup and authentication. You can also directly use the [Authentication API](/auth-api), without any wrapper at all, if you so choose.

![](/media/articles/libraries/lock-vs-customui/customui.png)

Unlike with **Lock**, neither of these options includes a user interface. You will have complete control over the user experience for signup and authentication flow, and for the UI aspects of layout, look and feel, branding, internationalization, RTL support, and more.

### When to use a custom user interface

Consider implementing a custom user interface in conjunction with an Auth0 library or the Authentication API for your app if:

* You have strict requirements for the appearance of the user interface
* You have strict requirements for file sizes - the Auth0 libraries are significantly smaller than Lock, and if you instead choose to deal with the API directly, that would require add no additional weight.
* You are comfortable with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - you'll be creating your own UI
* You only need to handle username/password and social provider authentication
* You have multiple database or Active Directory Connections
