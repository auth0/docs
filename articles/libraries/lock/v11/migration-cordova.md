# Migration from Lock in Cordova Applications

For Cordova applications, the only migration path forward at this time is to [migrate to Universal Login](/guides/login/migration-embedded-universal). Embedded Lock will not be supported in Cordova apps going forward, as part of an effort to align Auth0's Cordova support with more stringent standards and security policies.

Instead of updating embedded Lock versions, Cordova apps using Auth0 should instead use the [auth0-cordova](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-cordova) library to initiate [Universal Login](/hosted-pages/login) in Cordova apps. See the [Cordova Quickstart](/quickstart/native/cordova/01-login) for an example of setting this up.
