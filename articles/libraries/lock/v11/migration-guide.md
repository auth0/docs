# Migrating to Lock v11

[Lock v11](/libraries/lock) operates with enhanced security and removes dependencies that have been deprecated as per Auth0's roadmap. In some cases, these security enhancements may impact application behavior when upgrading from an earlier version of Lock. 

## Should I migrate to v11?

Everyone should migrate to v11. All previous versions are deprecated, and will be removed from service July 16, 2018. For applications that use Lock within an Auth0 login page, this migration is recommended; for applications with Lock embedded within them, this migration is mandatory.

::: note
Previously, deprecated Lock versions were planned to be removed from service on April 1, 2018. However, the Removal of Service date has been extended to **July 16, 2018** due to a [mitigation of the risks posed by deprecated versions](/cross-origin-authentication/fingerprinting). Customers are still encouraged to migrate applications to the latest version **as soon as possible** in order to ensure that applications continue to function properly.

## Disabling legacy Lock API

After you update to Lock v11 and/or Auth0.js v9, it is advised that you turn off the **Legacy Lock API** toggle in the Dashboard. This will make your Auth0 tenant behave as if the legacy API is no longer available. Starting on July 16, 2018, this option will be forcibly disabled, so it is recommended you opt-in before that time to verify that your configuration will work correctly. 

You can find the setting in the [Advanced section](${manage_url}/#/tenant/advanced) of Tenant Settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Lock takes long to display the login options

If Lock takes a lot of time to display the login options, it could be because the [Allowed Web Origins](/libraries/lock/v11/migration-v10-v11#configure-auth0-for-embedded-login) property is not correctly set.

To verify that this is a problem check your logs at [Dashboard > Logs](${manage_url}/#/logs). If you see an entry with the following error description, set the [Allowed Web Origins](/libraries/lock/v11/migration-v10-v11#configure-auth0-for-embedded-login) property and try again.

```text
The specified redirect_uri 'https://YOUR_APP_URL' does not have a registered domain.
```

### I upgraded but I still get deprecation warnings in the logs

You have already migrated to Lock 11 but you still see this error in your logs:

```text
Legacy Lock API: This feature is being deprecated. Please refer to our documentation to learn how to migrate your application.
```

These deprecation notices most likely originate from a user visiting the [Universal Login page](/hosted-pages/login) directly without initiating the authentication flow from your app. This can happen if a user bookmarks the login page directly. If this happens after **July 16, 2018** the user will not be able to log in.
