# Migrating React Applications to Lock v11

React applications use <dfn data-key="lock">Lock</dfn> directly without any kind of wrapper library.

Most React applications will be using Lock v10, so you can follow the [Migrating from Lock v10](/libraries/lock/v11/migration-v10-v11) guide.

If you were an early React and Auth0 adopter, and are using Lock v9, you can follow the [Migrating from Lock v9](/libraries/lock/v11/migration-v9-v11) guide.
