# Lock: Refresh Tokens

<%= include('../../../_includes/_version_warning_lock') %>

Mostly when building mobile apps, we want to show the signin page only once and then leave the user logged in forever. For those cases, it makes sense to have a `refreshToken`. A `refreshToken` lets us get a new ID Token (JWT) anytime we want.

::: warning
This means that if the `refreshToken` gets compromised, unless we revoke that token, somebody would be able to get a new JWT forever.
:::

## 1. Getting the Refresh Token

In order to be able to get the Refresh Token, all we need to do is add the scope `offline_access` when calling the `showSignin` or `showSignup` method. Optionally, we can specify a `device` name so that the user knows which device has a Refresh Token created. If not set, it'll be automatically calculated for you.

````js
lock.showSignin({
  authParams: {
    scope: 'openid offline_access',
    // The following is optional
    device: 'Chrome browser'
  }
});
````

If using popup mode, use the `refresh_token` returned in the callback:

```js
lock.showSignin({
  authParams: {
    scope: 'openid offline_access'
  }
}, function (err, profile, id_token, access_token, state, refresh_token) {
  // store refresh_token
});
```

## 2. Using the refreshToken

Now, you can use the `refreshToken` to get a new JWT whenever you want:

````js
lock.getClient().refreshToken(refresh_token, function (err, delegationResult) {
  // Get here the new JWT via delegationResult.id_token
});
````
