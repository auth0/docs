# Lock: Authentication Parameters

You can send parameters when starting a login by adding them to the options object. The example below adds a `state` parameter with a value equal to `'foo'`.

```js
var options = {
  auth: {
    params: {state: 'foo'},
  }
};  
```

The following parameters are supported: `access_token`, `scope`, `protocol`, `device`, `request_id`, `nonce` and `state`.

::: panel-info Note
This would be analogous to triggering the login with `https://${account.namespace}/authorize?state=foo&...`.

## Supported parameters

### scope {string}

```js
var options = {
  auth: {
    params: {scope: 'openid email user_metadata app_metadata picture'},
  }
};  
```

There are different values supported for scope:

* `scope: 'openid'`: _(default)_ It will return not only the `access_token`, but also an `id_token` which is a JSON Web Token (JWT). The JWT will only contain the user ID (`sub` claim).
* `scope: 'openid profile'`: (not recommended): will return all the user attributes in the token. This can cause problems when sending or receiving tokens in URLs (e.g. when using response_type=token) and will likely create an unnecessarily large token(especially with Azure AD which returns a fairly long JWT). Keep in mind that JWTs are sent on every API request, so it is desirable to keep them as small as possible.
* `scope: 'openid {attr1} {attr2} {attrN}'`: If you want only specific user attributes to be part of the `id_token` (For example: `scope: 'openid name email picture'`). When selecting specific attributes, the attributes chosen are from those available in the user's profile, which will vary from application to application.

For more information about scopes, see the [scopes documentation page](/scopes).

#### Example: retrieve a token with the profile data

If you want to do this using Lock widget version 10, you should add the `scope` parameter. For example in AngularJS you would use the initializing method of `authProvider`:

```js
authProvider.init({
    domain: AUTH0_DOMAIN,
    clientID: AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
    loginUrl: '/login',

    auth: {
        params: {
            scope: 'openid profile'
        }
    }
});
```

::: panel-info Connection Scopes
There is also a `connectionScopes` configuration option for Lock 10, which allows you to specify scopes on any specific connection. This will be useful if you want to initially start with a set of scopes (defined on the dashboard), but later on request additional permissions or attributes. Read more about it on the [Lock Configuration Options](/libraries/lock/v10/customization#connectionscopes-object-) page.

### state {string}

The `state` parameter is an arbitrary state value that will be mantained across redirects. It is useful to mitigate [XSRF attacks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) and for any contextual information, [such as a return url](/tutorials/redirecting-users), that you might need after the authentication process is finished.
