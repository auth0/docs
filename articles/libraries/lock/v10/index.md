# Lock 10 Preview

Lock 10 is a new version of the Auth0 authentication widget that provides:

* support for custom sign up fields;
* easier [redirect mode](/libraries/lock/authentication-modes#redirect-mode) implementation;
* improved UX;

Auth0 plans to have two beta releases and a release candidate.

Please note that the following features, which are available on Lock 9 (the current stable release), are not yet available with Lock 10:
- Enterprise connection support;
- Internationalization (i18n);
- Widget lifecycle events.

## What's new?

* Lock now uses Redirect Mode by default. To use Popup Mode, you must enable this explicitly.
* The Lock Public API has been updated so that the views are similar regardless of whether you are using Redirect Mode or Popup Mode. The Public API is also easier to use with Redirect Mode.
* The Beta 1 release of Lock does not support foreign languages, but you can still customize the dictionary via `dict`.
* You can create simple Lock themes using JavaScript to via `primaryColor` and `logo`. You may also make customizations using markup/CSS.
* The improved Lock UX comes with smoother transitions and animations and is keyboard friendly.
* Lock comes with support for pre-filled fields and custom avatar implementations.
* Lock comes with support for custom sign up fields.
