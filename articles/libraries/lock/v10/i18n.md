# Lock: Internationalization

You can instantiate Lock with the `language` option:

```js
// select a supported language
var options = {
  language: 'en'
};
```

Where dict can be a string matching the name of the file in the `i18n` folder.

You can also customize your own dictionary items using `languageDictionary`.

```js
var options = {
  languageDictionary: {
    emailInputPlaceholder: "something@youremail.com",
    title: "Log me in"
  },
};
```

> For an example of available property names, [see the English dictionary file for Lock](https://github.com/auth0/lock/blob/master/src/i18n/en.js).
