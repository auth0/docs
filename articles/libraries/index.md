## How Should You Implement Auth0?

When adding Auth0 to your web apps, the best solution is to use Auth0's [universal login](/hosted-pages/login). Using universal login is a simple process, and prevents the pitfalls of [cross-origin authentication](/cross-origin-authentication). The login page uses by default the Lock Widget to authenticate users, but there is also a template for Lock Passwordless and a template for a custom UI built with the Auth0.js SDK available. 

You can customize the page in the [Hosted Pages Editor](${manage_url}/#/login_page).

If universal login does not meet your requirements, however, Auth0 has a variety of options which can be embedded in your applications to assist with authentication.

* [Lock](#lock) is a drop-in authentication widget that provides a standard set of behaviors and a customizable user interface.
* [Auth0 SDKs](#auth0-sdks) are client-side libraries that do not come with a user interface. These allow for expanded customization of the behavior and appearance of the login process.
* The [Authentication API](/api/authentication) can be used to integrate applications with Auth0 without using any of the Auth0 libraries.

The best option to choose will depend on the needs of your app. Check out [When to Use Lock](/libraries/when-to-use-lock) for more information to help you decide between using Lock or an SDK.

## Lock

The Lock widget is a simple way to integrate Auth0 into existing projects and provide the frictionless login and signup experience that you want for your app. Lock gives your users a customizable UI with which to authenticate in your app.

The Lock widget for each platform has detailed reference documentation.

## Auth0 SDKs

Auth0 SDKs include no UI. Instead, you would use one of these SDKs alongside your custom UI.
