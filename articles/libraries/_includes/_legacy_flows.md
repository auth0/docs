### Migrating from legacy authentication flows

The OIDC conformant flows disallow certain practices that were common when developing applications with older versions of the library, like using <dfn data-key="refresh-token">Refresh Tokens</dfn>, using [ID Tokens](/tokens/concepts/id-tokens) to call APIs, and [accessing non-standard claims in the user profile](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/scope-custom-claims).

Follow the steps in the [Migration from Legacy Authentication Flows](guides/migration-legacy-flows) to learn what changes you need to make in your application.
