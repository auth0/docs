### Usage in popup mode

When using [popup mode](libraries/lock/authentication-modes#popup-mode) in previous versions of Lock, a new browser window was opened and immediately closed in order to complete the authentication transaction. In Lock 11, that window is opened on a hidden iframe, providing a better user experience.
