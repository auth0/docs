# Auth0.swift

Auth0.swift is a client-side library for Auth0.

::: note
Check out the [Auth0.swift repository](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) on GitHub.
:::

## Requirements

- iOS 9 or later
- Xcode 8
- Swift 3.0

## Installation

### Carthage

If you are using Carthage, add the following lines to your `Cartfile`:

```ruby
github "auth0/Auth0.swift" ~> 1.0
```

Then run `carthage bootstrap`.

::: note
For more information about Carthage usage, check [the official documentation](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#if-youre-building-for-ios-tvos-or-watchos).
:::

### Cocoapods

If you are using [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/), add these lines to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
use_frameworks!
pod 'Auth0', '~> 1.0'
```

Then, run `pod install`.

::: note
For further reference on Cocoapods, check [the official documentation](http://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

## Adding Auth0 Credentials

You will need to add an `Auth0.plist` file, containing your Auth0 client id and domain, to your main bundle. Here is an example of the file contents:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
   <key>ClientId</key>
   <string>${account.clientId}</string>
   <key>Domain</key>
   <string>${account.namespace}</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

### Web-based Auth (iOS Only)

First go to [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/applications) and go to application's settings. Make sure you have in **Allowed Callback URLs** a URL with the following format:

```text
{YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER}://${account.namespace}/ios/{YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER}/callback
```

In your application's `Info.plist` file register your iOS Bundle Identifier as a custom scheme like this:

```xml
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>None</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLName</key>
        <string>auth0</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
        <array>
            <string>{YOUR_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER}</string>
        </array>
    </dict>
</array>
```

::: note
If your `Info.plist` is not shown in this format, you can **Right Click** on `Info.plist` in Xcode and then select **Open As / Source Code**.
:::

::: note
Auth0.swift will only handle URLs with your Auth0 domain as host, for example `com.auth0.MyApp://samples.auth0.com/ios/com.auth0.MyApp/callback`
:::

Allow Auth0 to handle authentication callbacks. In your `AppDelegate.swift` add the following:

```swift
func application(_ app: UIApplication, open url: URL, options: [UIApplicationOpenURLOptionsKey : Any]) -> Bool {
    return Auth0.resumeAuth(url, options: options)
}
```

#### Authenticate with universal login

The first step in adding authentication to your iOS application is to provide a way for your users to log in. The fastest, most secure, and most feature-rich way to do this with Auth0 is to use [universal login](/hosted-pages/login).

::: note
To ensure an [OpenID Connect compliant response](/api-auth/intro), you must either request an `audience` or enable the **OIDC Conformant** switch in your [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}), under **Application > Settings > Show Advanced Settings > OAuth**. For more information, refer to [How to use the new flows](/api-auth/intro#how-to-use-the-new-flows).
:::

```swift
Auth0
    .webAuth()
    .audience("https://${account.namespace}/userinfo")
    .start { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let credentials):
            print("credentials: \(credentials)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print(error)
        }
    }
```

::: note
If you need help between the two types of login flows, refer to [Browser-Based vs. Native Login Flows on Mobile Devices](/tutorials/browser-based-vs-native-experience-on-mobile)
:::

#### Authenticate with a specific Auth0 connection

The `connection` option allows you to specify a connection that you wish to authenticate with. If no connection is specified here, the browser will show the login page, with all of the connections which are enabled for this application.

```swift
Auth0
    .webAuth()
    .connection("facebook")
    .audience("https://${account.namespace}/userinfo")
    .start { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let credentials):
            print("credentials: \(credentials)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print(error)
        }
    }
```

#### Authenticate using a specific scope

Using scopes can allow you to return specific claims for specfic fields in your request. Adding parameters to `scope` will allow you to add more scopes. The default scope is `openid`, and you should read our [documentation on scopes](/scopes) for further details about them.

```swift
Auth0
    .webAuth()
    .scope("openid email")
    .connection("google-oauth2")
    .audience("https://${account.namespace}/userinfo")
    .start { result in
        switch result {
        case .success(let credentials):
            print("credentials: \(credentials)")
        case .failure(let error):
            print(error)
        }
    }
```

### Getting user information

In order to retrieve a user's profile, you call the `userInfo` method and pass it the user's `accessToken`.  Although the call returns a [UserInfo](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift/blob/master/Auth0/UserInfo.swift) instance, this is a basic OIDC conformant profile and the only guaranteed claim is the `sub` which contains the user's id, but depending on the requested scope the claims returned may vary.  You can also use the `sub` value to call the [Management API](#Management-API) and return a full user profile.

```swift
Auth0
   .authentication()
   .userInfo(withAccessToken: accessToken)
   .start { result in
       switch result {
       case .success(let profile):
           print("User Profile: \(profile)")
       case .failure(let error):
           print("Failed with \(error)")
       }
   }
```
