# Android Development Keystores and Key Hashes

When creating a new OAuth Credential for many connections you will need to provide the SHA-1 of the certificate you're using to sign your application. When completing your Application's configuration in the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}) you will also need to provide the SHA-256 value.

Locate the certificate you're using to sign your application. If you don't have one you can generate it. For production applications, you should do this.

During development, you can sign your application with the default `android.keystore` certificate that was generated automatically for you when you installed the SDK. In this example we're going to use this default keystore. To generate the key hashes using this keystore follow the examples below.

## Generating your key hashes

**On Windows:**

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore "%USERPROFILE%\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

**On Linux / macOS:**

```bash
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

**Sample output:**

```text
Alias name: androiddebugkey
Creation date: Jan 01, 2013
Entry type: PrivateKeyEntry
Certificate chain length: 1
Certificate[1]:
Owner: CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US
Issuer: CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US
Serial number: 4aa9b300
Valid from: Mon Jan 01 08:04:04 UTC 2013 until: Mon Jan 01 18:04:04 PST 2033
Certificate fingerprints:
     MD5:  AE:9F:95:D0:A6:86:89:BC:A8:70:BA:34:FF:6A:AC:F9
     SHA1: BB:0D:AC:74:D3:21:E1:43:07:71:9B:62:90:AF:A1:66:6E:44:5D:75
     SHA256: 15:B9:F9:33:9F:E4:E3:68:C2:10:49:17:5D:A8:77:12:7C:8E:57:E9:FF:B7:23:EA:CC:DD:56:08:06:C9:5E:33
     Signature algorithm name: SHA256withRSA
     Version: 3
```

## Using your key hashes

Once you have your key hashes output, copy the resulting SHA256 value and go to your application's settings in the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/applications). Click "Show Advanced Settings", and in the "Mobile Settings" tab, under "Android", fill the "App Package Name" with your application's package name, and the "Key Hashes" field with the SHA256 value you copied. Don't forget to save the changes.

::: warning
If you don't add the Callback URL to the application settings nor the Key Hashes to the application's mobile settings, the Auth0 server won't return the call result to your application.
