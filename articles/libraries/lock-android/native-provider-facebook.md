# Native Provider - Facebook

You can use Facebook AuthProvider to log in with or without **Lock**. Make sure to follow the instructions in the [setup](#setup) section.

## Latest version

The Lock-Facebook is available through [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org) and [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter). To install it, simply add the following line to your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
compile 'com.auth0.android:lock-facebook:3.0.1'
```

## Requirements

Android 4.0 or later & Facebook Android SDK 4.+

## Github Repository

[https://github.com/auth0/Lock-Facebook.Android](https://github.com/auth0/Lock-Facebook.Android)

## Setup

### Facebook Developers Console
1. Go to the [Facebook Developers Console](https://developers.facebook.com/) and create a new App: Choose "Android" and give it a valid name. Click "Create new Facebook App ID".
2. Add your application's **Package Name** and the name of the **Activity class** where you're using the provider and click the Next button.
3. Add the **SHA-1** Base64 encoded Key Hashes of the certificates you're using to sign your application and click the Next button. If you need help obtaining the SHA-1 check [this](#certificate-fingerprints) section.
4. Finally, scroll to the top of the page and click the Skip Quickstart button to go to your Facebook app's page.
5. On the top of the page, you will find the `APP ID` and `APP SECRET` values. Save them as you're going to need them later.
6. On the left side you have the navigation drawer. Click Settings and then Basic. Turn ON the **Single Sign On** switch and click the Save button.
7. Click Settings and then Advanced. Turn ON the **Native or desktop app?** switch.

### Auth0 Dashboard
1. Go to the Auth0 Dashboard and click [Social Connections](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/social).
2. Click **Facebook** and a dialog will prompt.
3. Complete the "App ID" field with the `APP ID` value obtained in the step 5 of the **Facebook Developers Console** section above.
3. Complete the "App Secret" field with the `APP SECRET` value obtained in the step 5 of the **Facebook Developers Console** section above.
6. Click the Save button.
7. Go to the Auth0 Dashboard and click [Clients](https://manage.auth0.com/#/clients). If you haven't created yet one, do that first and get into your client configuration page.
8. At the bottom of the page, click the "Show Advanced Settings" link and go to the "Mobile Settings" tab.
9. In the Android section, complete the **Package Name** with your application's package name. Finally, complete the **Key Hashes** field with the SHA-256 of the certificate you're using to sign your application. If you need help obtaining the SHA-256 check [this](#certificate-fingerprints) section. Click the "Save Changes" button.

### Android Application
1. In your android application, create a new String resource in the `res/strings.xml` file. Name it `facebook_app_id` and set as value the `APP ID` obtained in the step 5 of the **Facebook Developers Console** setup section above.
2. Add the `FacebookActivity` and `facebook_app_id` MetaData to the AndroidManifest.xml file, inside the Application tag.

```xml
<activity
    android:name="com.facebook.FacebookActivity"
    android:configChanges="keyboard|keyboardHidden|screenLayout|screenSize|orientation"
    android:label="@string/app_name"/>
<meta-data
    android:name="com.facebook.sdk.ApplicationId"
    android:value="@string/facebook_app_id" />
```

3. Add the Internet Android permission to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
```

4. Create a new instance of the `FacebookAuthProvider`.

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
  private FacebookAuthProvider provider;
  // ...

  @Override
  protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
    Auth0 auth0 = new Auth0(getString(R.string.com_auth0_client_id), getString(R.string.com_auth0_domain));
    final AuthenticationAPIClient client = new AuthenticationAPIClient(auth0);
    provider = new FacebookAuthProvider(client);
  }

  // ...
}
```

> If you need further help with the setup, please check Facebook's [Getting Started Guide](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started).

## Usage with Lock

If you plan to use this provider with **Lock**, pass the instance of the provider to the `FacebookAuthHandler` class and add it to Lock's Builder when you create the instance.

```java
FacebookAuthHandler handler = new FacebookAuthHandler(provider);
lock = Lock.newBuilder(auth0, authCallback)
        .withAuthHandlers(handler)
        //...
        .build(this);
```

## Usage without Lock

If you plan to use this provider without **Lock**, make sure you override the `onActivityResult()` method and redirect the call to the provider instance. Finally, call start to begin the authentication process.

```java
@Override
protected void onActivityResult(int requestCode, int resultCode, Intent data) {
    if (provider.authorize(requestCode, resultCode, data)) {
        return;
    }
    super.onActivityResult(requestCode, resultCode, data);
}

private void beginAuthentication(){
  provider.start(this, callback, RC_PERMISSIONS, RC_AUTHENTICATION);
}
```

That's it, you're ready to run the application and log in with Facebook native provider!!

## Additional options

### Using a custom connection name
To use a custom social connection name to authorize against Auth0, call `setConnection` with your new connection name.

```java
FacebookAuthProvider provider = new FacebookAuthProvider("my_connection_name", client);
```

### Requesting custom Facebook Permissions
By default, the permission `public_profile` is requested. You can customize them by calling `setPermissions` with the list of Permissions.

```java
provider.setPermissions(Arrays.asList("public_profile", "user_photos"));
```

### Requesting custom Android Runtime Permissions
This provider doesn't require any special Android Manifest Permission to authenticate the user. But if your use case requires them, you can let the AuthProvider handle them for you. Use the `setRequiredPermissions` method.

```java
provider.setRequiredPermissions(new String[]{"android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS"});
```

### Log out / Clear account.
To log out the user so that the next time they are prompted to input their credentials call `clearSession`. After you do this the provider state will be invalid and you will need to call `start` again before trying to `authorize` a result. Calling `stop` has the same effect.

```java
provider.clearSession();
```

### Remember the Last Login
By default, this provider will remember the last account used to log in. If you want to change this behavior, use the following method.

```java
provider.rememberLastLogin(false);
```


## Certificate Fingerprints
When creating a new App in the Facebook Developers Console, you will need to provide the SHA-1 of the certificate you're using to sign your application in Base64 encoding. To obtain it follow this steps:

Locate the certificate you're using to sign your application. If you don't have one you can generate it or use the default `android.keystore` certificate, that was generated automatically for you when you installed the SDK. In this example we're going to use the default one.

* On Windows:

```sh
keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore %USERPROFILE%\.android\debug.keystore -storepass android | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64
```

* On Linux / macOS:

```sh
keytool -exportcert -alias androiddebugkey -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -storepass android | openssl sha1 -binary | openssl base64
```

Sample output:

```
no71633JAC3qgzQYCbskprUr55k=
```

In your Auth0 Dashboard Client's settings, you will need to provide the SHA-256 of the certificate you're using to sign your application. To obtain it follow this steps:

* On Windows:

```sh
keytool -list -v -keystore "%USERPROFILE%\.android\debug.keystore" -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

* On Linux / macOS

```sh
keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android
```

Sample output:

```
Alias name: androiddebugkey
Creation date: Jan 01, 2013
Entry type: PrivateKeyEntry
Certificate chain length: 1
Certificate[1]:
Owner: CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US
Issuer: CN=Android Debug, O=Android, C=US
Serial number: 4aa9b300
Valid from: Mon Jan 01 08:04:04 UTC 2013 until: Mon Jan 01 18:04:04 PST 2033
Certificate fingerprints:
     MD5:  AE:9F:95:D0:A6:86:89:BC:A8:70:BA:34:FF:6A:AC:F9
     SHA1: BB:0D:AC:74:D3:21:E1:43:07:71:9B:62:90:AF:A1:66:6E:44:5D:75
   	 SHA256: 15:B9:F9:33:9F:E4:E3:68:C2:10:49:17:5D:A8:77:12:7C:8E:57:E9:FF:B7:23:EA:CC:DD:56:08:06:C9:5E:33
     Signature algorithm name: SHA256withRSA
     Version: 3
```

The value you need for the Auth0 Dashboard is in the **SHA-256** line.
