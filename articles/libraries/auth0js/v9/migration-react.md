# Migrating React Applications to Auth0.js v9

React applications use auth0.js directly without any kind of wrapper library.

Most React applications will be using auth0.js v8, so you can follow the [Migrating from Auth0.js v8](/libraries/auth0js/v9/migration-v8-v9) guide.

If you were an early React and Auth0 adopter, and are using auth0.js v7, you can follow the [Migrating from Auth0.js v7](/libraries/auth0js/v9/migration-v7-v9) guide.
