# Migrating to Auth0.js v9

[Auth0.js v9](/libraries/auth0js) has been improved to operate with enhanced security and removes dependencies that have been deprecated as per Auth0's roadmap. In some cases, these security enhancements may impact application behavior when upgrading from an earlier versions of auth0.js. 

## Should I migrate to v9?

Everyone should migrate to v9. All previous versions are deprecated, and will be removed from service July 16, 2018. For applications that use Auth0.js within an Auth0 login page, this migration is recommended; for applications with Auth0.js embedded within them, this migration is mandatory.

::: panel Legacy Lock API Removed from Service
Previously, the Legacy Lock API (used by deprecated versions of Auth0.js) was planned to be removed from service on April 1, 2018. However, the Removal of Service date was extended to **July 16, 2018** due to a [mitigation of the risks posed by deprecated versions](/cross-origin-authentication/fingerprinting).

As of the week of July 16, 2018, the Legacy Lock API will be disabled. You can temporarily re-enable it in order to make any necessary changes or finish your migration, but on July 30th it will be disabled permanantly. See [the announcement](https://community.auth0.com/t/soft-removal-of-legacy-lock-api/12949) for more information.

## Troubleshooting

### I upgraded but I still get deprecation warnings in the logs

You have already migrated to Auth0.js 9 but you still see this error in your logs:

```text
Legacy Lock API: This feature is being deprecated. Please refer to our documentation to learn how to migrate your application.
```

These deprecation notices most likely originate from a user visiting the [Universal Login page](/hosted-pages/login) directly without initiating the authentication flow from your app. This can happen if a user bookmarks the login page directly. If this happens after **July 16, 2018** the user will not be able to log in. 

Check out the [Deprecation Error Reference](/errors/deprecation-errors) for more information on deprecation related errors.
