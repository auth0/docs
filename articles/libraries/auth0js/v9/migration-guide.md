# Migrating to Auth0.js v9

[Auth0.js v9](/libraries/auth0js) has been improved to operate with enhanced security and removes dependencies that have been deprecated as per Auth0's roadmap. In some cases, these security enhancements may impact application behavior when upgrading from an earlier versions of auth0.js. 

## Should I migrate to v9?

Everyone should migrate to v9. All previous versions are deprecated, and will be removed from service July 16, 2018. For applications that use Auth0.js within an Auth0 login page, this migration is recommended; for client applications with Auth0.js embedded within them, this migration is mandatory.

::: note
Previously, deprecated Auth0.js versions were planned to be removed from service on April 1, 2018. However, the Removal of Service date has been extended to **July 16, 2018**. Customers are still encouraged to migrate applications to the latest version **as soon as possible** in order to ensure that applications continue to function properly.
