# Auth0.js v8 Reference

Auth0.js is a client-side library for [Auth0](http://auth0.com). Using auth0.js in your web apps makes it easier to do authentication and authorization with Auth0 in your web apps.

::: panel-info Auth0.js v8
This document covers the most up-to-date version of auth0.js - version 8. If you are already using version 7, you can take a look at the [v7 reference guide](/libraries/auth0js/v7).
:::

## Ready-to-Go Example

The [example directory](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js/tree/master/example) of the auth0.js library is a ready-to-go app that can help you to quickly and easily try out auth0.js. In order to run it, follow these quick steps:
1. If you don't have [node](http://nodejs.org/) installed, do that now
1. Download dependencies by running `npm install` from the root of this project
1. Finally, execute `npm start` from the root of this project, and then browse to your app running on the node server, presumably at `http://localhost:3000/example`.

## Setup and Initialization

Now, let's get started integrating auth0.js into your project. We'll cover [methods of installation](#installation-options), [how to initialize auth0.js](#initialization), [signup](#signup), [login](#login), [logout](#logout), and more!

### Installation Options

You have a few options for using auth0.js in your project. Pick one of the below depending on your needs:

Install via [npm](https://npmjs.org):

```sh
npm install auth0-js
```

Install via [bower](http://bower.io):

```sh
bower install auth0.js
```
```html
<script src="bower_components/auth0.js/build/auth0.min.js"></script>
```

Include via our CDN:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/auth0/8.0.4/auth0.min.js"></script>
```

>Note that for production use, the latest patch release (for example, 8.0.0) is recommended, rather than the latest minor release indicated above.

If you are using a bundler, you will want to install with `npm i auth0-js --production --save`.

### Initialization

Initialize a new instance of the Auth0 client as follows:

```html
<script src="${auth0js_url}"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  var webAuth = new auth0.WebAuth({
    domain:       '${account.namespace}',
    clientID:     '${account.clientId}'
  });
</script>
```

#### Available Parameters

##### Required

* **domain** {string}: Your Auth0 account domain (ex. myaccount.auth0.com)
* **client\_id** {string}: Your Auth0 client\_id

##### Optional

* **redirectUri** {string}: The default redirectUri used. Defaults to an empty string (none).
* **scope** {string}: The default scope used by the application. Using scopes can allow you to return specific claims for specific fields in your request. You should read our [documentation on scopes](/scopes) for further details about them.
* **audience** {string}: The default audience used for requesting API Access.
* **responseType** {string}: The default responseType used, 'token' or 'code'. Defaults to 'token', unless a `redirectUri` is provided, then defaults to 'code'.
* **responseMode** {string}: This option is omitted by default. Can be set to 'form_post' in order to send the token or code to the `redirectUri` via POST.
* **_disableDeprecationWarnings** {boolean}: Disables the deprecation warnings, defaults to false.

## Login

### Hosted Login Page

To login via the [hosted login page](/hosted-pages/login), use the `authorize` method. This redirects to the hosted login page to initialize an authN/authZ transaction. 

```js
webAuth.authorize({
  audience: 'url:auth:some-audience',
  scope: 'read:something write:otherthing',
  responseType: 'token',
  redirectUri: 'https://example.com/auth/callback'
});
```

Note that the same `authorize` method can be used with a 'connection' parameter to facilitate social connection logins, as well.

### Custom Username and Password

The `client.login` method can be used when you need to request a username and password and authenticate from your site, instead of using the [hosted login page](/hosted-pages/login). This method can be used for database and ldap connections. This will not initialize a SSO session in Auth0, hence cannot be used along with `renewAuth`.

```js
webAuth.client.login({
  realm: 'Username-Password-Authentication', //connection name or HRD domain
  username: 'info@auth0.com',
  password: 'areallystrongpassword',
  audience: 'https://mystore.com/api/v2',
  scope: 'read:order write:order',
  }, function(err, authResult) {
    // Auth tokens in the result or an error
});
```

## Logout

To logout a user, use the `logout` method. This accepts an options object, which can include a 'client_id', and a 'returnTo' URL. If you want to navigate the user to a specific URL after the logout, set that URL at the 'returnTo' parameter.

::: panel-info returnTo parameter
Note that if the 'client\_id' parameter _is_ included, the 'returnTo' URL that is provided must be listed in the **client's** "Allowed Logout URLs" in the Auth0 dashboard. 
However, if the 'client\_id' parameter _is not_ included, the 'returnTo' URL must be listed in the "Allowed Logout URLs" at the **account level** in the Auth0 Dashboard.
:::

```js
webAuth.logout({
  returnTo: 'some url here',
  client_id: 'some client ID here'
});
```

## Signup
 
The `signup` method accepts an 'options' object that contains parameters for your signup. Note that signups should be for database connections. Here is an example of the `signup` method and some sample code for a form. 

```html 
<h2>Signup Database Connection</h2> 
<input class="signup-username" /> 
<input type="password" class="signup-password" /> 
<input type="button" class="signup-db" value="Signup!" /> 
<script type="text/javascript"> 
    $('.signup-db').click(function (e) { 
        e.preventDefault(); 
        webAuth.signup({ 
            connection: 'Username-Password-Authentication', 
            email: $('.signup-email').val(), 
            password: $('.signup-password').val(), 
            sso: true, 
            popup: true, 
            auto_login: false 
        }, function (err) { 
            if (err) return alert('Something went wrong: ' + err.message); 
            return alert('success signup without login!') 
        }); 
    }); 
</script> 
``` 

## Using renewAuth to Acquire New Tokens

The `renewAuth` method allows you to acquire a new token from Auth0 for a user who is already authenticated against the hosted login page.

```js
webAuth.renewAuth({
  audience: 'https://example.com/api/v2',
  scope: 'read:something write:otherthing',
  redirectUri: 'https://example.com/auth/silent-callback',
  usePostMessage: true
}, function (err, authResult) {
    ...
});
```

::: panel-info postMessage
This will use postMessage to comunicate between the silent callback and the SPA. When false the SDK will attempt to parse the url hash, should ignore the url hash, and no extra behaviour is needed.
:::

The callback page should be something like the following one. It will parse the url hash and post it to the parent document:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="${auth0js_url}"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript">
      var webAuth = new auth0.WebAuth({
        domain: '${account.namespace}',
        clientID: '...'
      });
      var result = webAuth.parseHash(window.location.hash);
      if (result) {
        parent.postMessage(result, "https://example.com/"); //The second parameter should be your domain
      }
    </script>
  </head>
  <body></body>
</html>
```

## Password Reset Requests

If attempting to set up a password reset functionality, you'll use the `changePassword` method and pass in an "options" object, with a "connection" parameter and an "email" parameter.

```js
  $('.change_password').click(function () {
    webAuth.changePassword({
      connection: 'db-conn',
      email:   'foo@bar.com'
    }, function (err, resp) {
      if(err){
        console.log(err.message);
      }else{
        console.log(resp);
      }
    });
  });
```

The user will then receive an email which will contain a link that they can follow to reset their password.

## User Management 

The Management API provides functionality that allows you to link and unlink separate user accounts from different providers, tying them to a single profile (Read more about [Linking Accounts](/link-accounts) with Auth0). It also allows you to update user metadata.

To get started, create a new `auth0.Management` instance by passing it the account's Auth0 domain, and the token for the primary identity. In the case of linking users, this primary identity is the user profile that you want to "keep" the data for, and which you plan to link other identities to.

```js
var auth0Manage = new auth0.Management({
  domain: '${account.namespace}',
  token: "YOUR_PRIMARY_IDENTITY_TOKEN"
});
```

### Getting the User Profile

In order to get the user profile data, use the `getUser()` method, with the `userId` and a callback as parameters. The method returns the user profile. https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users_by_id.

```js
getUser(userId, cb);
```

### Updating the User Profile

When updating user metadata, you will need to first create a `metadata` object, and then call the `patchUserMetadata` method, passing it the user id and the `metadata` object you created. The values in this object will overwrite existing values with the same key, or add new ones for those that don't yet exist in the user metadata.

```js
patchUserMetadata(userId, userMetadata, cb);
```

### Linking Users

Linking user accounts will allow a user to authenticate from any of their accounts and no matter which one they use, still pull up the same profile upon login. Auth0 treats all of these accounts as separate profiles by default, so if you wish a user's accounts to be linked, this is the way to go.

The `linkUser` method accepts two parameters, the primary user id and the secondary user token (the token obtained after login with this identity). The user id in question is the unique identifier for this user account. If the id is in the format `facebook|1234567890`, the id required is the portion after the delimiting pipe.

```js
linkUser(userId, secondaryUserToken, cb): Link two users. https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2#!/Users/post_identities
```

::: panel-info Linking - Metadata
Note that when accounts are linked, the secondary account's metadata is **not** merged with the primary account's metadata, and if they are ever unlinked, the secondary account will likewise not retain the primary account's metadata when it becomes separate again.
