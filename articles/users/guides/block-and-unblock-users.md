To disable a user's access to your apps, you can block the user in the Dashboard:

1. Go to the [Users](${manage_url}/#/users) page in the Dashboard
2. Click the name of the user you want to block
3. When the User Details page opens, click the **Actions** button.
4. Select **Block User** from the dropdown menu.
