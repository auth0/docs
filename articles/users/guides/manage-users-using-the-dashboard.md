# Manage Users Using the Dashboard

You can use the Dashboard to manage your users. To begin, go to [Dashboard > Users](${manage_url}/#/users). This is where you'll go to create, view, modify, or delete users.

::: note
User Management is included as part of the **Developer** subscription plan. You may need to [upgrade your plan](${manage_url}/#/tenant/billing/subscription) to access these features.
