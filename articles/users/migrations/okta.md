# Migrate Users from Okta to Auth0

Auth0 supports [automatic migration](/users/migrations/automatic) of users from a [custom database connection](/connections/database/custom-db) to Auth0. This feature allows you to configure a custom database connection which will migrate users from an external application, such as Okta, to Auth0. It allows for a smooth migration of users over time, without requiring users to reset their password as a result of the migration.

For a more detailed overview, also refer to [The Migration Process](/connections/database/migrating#the-migration-process).

The rest of this document will walk you through the process of configuring a custom database connection which imports users from Okta. It assumes that you have an Okta account.

## Configuring the Custom Database Connection

### 1. Create a Custom Database

You can create a new database connection in the [Connections > Database](${manage_url}/#/connections/database) section of the Dashboard.

![Create a new DB Connection](/media/articles/connections/database/okta/create-database-connection.png)

On the **Custom Database** page, enable the **Use my own database** option:

![DB Login Page in Dashboard](/media/articles/connections/database/okta/own-database.png)

### 2. Turn on Automatic Migration

On the **Settings** page for your database connection, enable the **Import Users to Auth0** option:

![Dashboard Import Users Option](/media/articles/connections/database/okta/import-users.png)

### 3. Create the Login Script

The **Login** script is executed when a user attempts to log in, but their account is not found in the Auth0 database. You will need to create a script which will call the Okta [Primary Authentication](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn.html#primary-authentication) endpoint, passing the email and password as the `username` and `password` parameters.

On successful authentication, Okta will return an [Authentication Transaction object](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn.html#authentication-transaction-model), containing the [user's profile](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn.html#user-profile-object) in the [embedded resources](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/authn.html#embedded-resources). You can then simply extract the user's information and pass it to Auth0 in the callback function.

```js
function login (email, password, callback) {
  // Replace YOUR-OKTA-DOMAIN with your own Okta domain
  var url = 'https:/YOUR-OKTA-DOMAIN/api/v1/authn';

  // Make the POST request to authenticate a user
  request({
    url: url,
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Accept': 'application/json'
    },
    body: {
      username: email,
      password: password,
      options: {
        multiOptionalFactorEnroll: false,
        warnBeforePasswordExpired: false
      }
    },
    json: true
  }, function (error, response, body) {
    // Ensure we have a successful response
    if (response.statusCode !== 200) return callback();
    
    // Get the user from the response body
    var user = body._embedded.user;
    
    // Set the data we want to store in Auth0 and migrate the user
    return callback(null, {
        user_id : user.id,
        username: user.profile.login,
        email: user.profile.login,
        // We set the users email_verified to true as we assume if they were a valid
        // user in Okta, they have already verified their email
        // If this field is not set, the user will get an email asking them to verify
        // their account
        email_verified: true,
        name: user.profile.firstName + ' ' + user.profile.lastName
      });
  });
}
```

You can click the **Try** button above the script to test and see whether the script works.

### 4. Create the Get User Script

The **Get User** script is executed when the user attempts to do a password reset but their account is not found in the Auth0 database. You will need to create a script which will call the Okta [Get User with Login](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/users.html#get-user-with-login) endpoint, passing the user's email as the `login` parameter.

You will also need to [Create an API token](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/getting_a_token.html) which must be passed to this endpoint in the `Authorization` header.

If successful, Okta will return a [User object](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/resources/users.html#user-model) with the user's information. Once again, you can extract the user's information and pass it to Auth0 in the callback function.

```js
function getByEmail(email, callback) {
  // Replace YOUR-OKTA-DOMAIN with your own Okta domain
  var url = 'https://YOUR-OKTA-DOMAIN/api/v1/users/' + encodeURIComponent(email);

  // Make a GET request to find a user by email
  // Replace YOUR-OKTA-API-TOKEN with an Okta API Token 
  // (see https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/getting_started/getting_a_token.html) 
  request({
    url: url,
    method: 'GET',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Accept': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': 'SSWS ' + 'YOUR-OKTA-API-TOKEN'
    },
    json: true
  }, function (error, response, body) {
    // Ensure we have a successful response
    if (response.statusCode !== 200) return callback();

    // Set the data we want to store in Auth0 and migrate the user
    return callback(null, {
      user_id: body.id,
      username: body.profile.login,
      email: body.profile.login,
      email_verified: true,
      name: body.profile.firstName + ' ' + body.profile.lastName
    });
  });
}
```

You can click the **Try** button above the script to test and see whether the script works.

## Testing the Custom Database Connection

At this point you can test the custom database connection to ensure that it works.

Click on **Try connection**:

![Try Connection](/media/articles/connections/database/okta/try-connection.png)

The Auth0 Lock widget will appear. Enter the email address and password for the Okta user, and click on **Log In**:

![Try Connection - Lock](/media/articles/connections/database/okta/try-connection-lock.png)

You should see a web page indicating that the connection works, with information about the user:

![Try Connection - Success](/media/articles/connections/database/okta/try-connection-success.png)

If you navigate to the [Users](${manage_url}/#/users) section in the Auth0 Dashboard, you will see the newly imported user listed:

![Imported User](/media/articles/connections/database/okta/user-imported.png)
