# Migrate Users from Stormpath to Auth0

Auth0 supports [automatic migration](/users/migrations/automatic) of users from a [custom database connection](/connections/database/custom-db) to Auth0. This feature allows you to configure a custom database connection which will migrate users from an external application, such as Stormpath, to Auth0. It allows for a smooth migration of users over time, without requiring users to reset their password as a result of the migration.

For a more detailed overview, also refer to [The Migration Process](/users/migrations/automatic#the-migration-process).

The rest of this document will walk you through the process of configuring a custom database connection which imports users from Stormpath. It assumes that you have a Stormpath account.

## Configuring the Custom Database Connection

### 1. Create a Custom Database

You can create a new database connection in the [Connections > Database](${manage_url}/#/connections/database) section of the Dashboard.

![Create a new Database Connection](/media/articles/users/migrations/create-database-connection.png)

On the **Custom Database** page, enable the **Use my own database** option:

![Database Login Page in Dashboard](/media/articles/users/migrations/own-database.png)

### 2. Turn on Automatic Migration

On the **Settings** page for your database connection, enable the **Import Users to Auth0** option:

![Dashboard Import Users Option](/media/articles/users/migrations/import-users.png)

### 3. Enable Applications

Navigate to the **Applications** tab of your database connection. Here you can choose the applications which will use the database connection.

![Database Connection Applications](/media/articles/users/migrations/enable-clients.png)

### 4. Create the Login Script

The **Login** script is executed when a user attempts to log in, but their account is not found in the Auth0 database. You will need to create a script that calls Stormpath's API to authenticate the user, passing the user credentials as the `username` and `password` parameters.

On successful authentication, the response from Stormpath will include the user account URL. Perform a second request to the account URL to retrieve the user's information. You can then extract the user's information and pass it to Auth0 in the callback function.

```js
function login(username, password, callback) {
  // Replace the YOUR-CLIENT-ID attribute with your Stormpath ID
  var url = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/{YOUR-CLIENT-ID}/loginAttempts';

  // Stormpath requires the user credentials be passed in as a base64 encoded message
  var message = username + ':' + password;
  var pass = new Buffer(message).toString('base64');

  // Here we are making the POST request to authenticate a user
  request({
    url: url,
    method: 'POST',
    auth: {
      // Your API Client ID
      user: '{STORMPATH-CLIENT-ID}',
      // YOUR API Client Secret
      password: '{STORMPATH-CLIENT-SECRET}'
    },
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    json: {
      type: 'basic',
      // Passing in the base64 encoded credentials
      value: pass
    }
  }, function (error, response, body) {
    // If response is successful we'll continue
    if (response.statusCode !== 200) return callback();
    // A successful response will return a URL to get the user information
    var accountUrl = body.account.href;

    // We'll make a second request to get the user info. This time it will be a GET request
    request({
      url: accountUrl,
      method: 'GET',
      auth: {
        // Your API Client ID
        user: '{STORMPATH-CLIENT-ID}',
        // YOUR API Client Secret
        password: '{STORMPATH-CLIENT-SECRET}'
      }
    }, function (errorUserInfo, responseUserInfo, bodyUserInfo) {
      // If we get a successful response, we'll process it
      if (responseUserInfo.statusCode !== 200) return callback();

      var parsedBody = JSON.parse(bodyUserInfo);
      // To get the user identifier, we'll strip out the Stormpath API
      var id = parsedBody.href.replace('https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/', '');

      // Finally, we'll set the data we want to store in Auth0 and migrate the user
      return callback(null, {
        user_id : id,
        username: parsedBody.username,
        email: parsedBody.email,
        // We set the users email_verified to true as we assume if they were a valid
        // user in Stormpath, they have already verified their email
        // If this field is not set, the user will get an email asking them to verify
        // their account
        email_verified: true,
        // Add any additional fields you would like to carry over from Stormpath
      });
    });
  });
}
```

You can click the **Try** button above the script to test and see whether the script works.

### 5. Create the Get User Script

The **Get User** script is executed when the user attempts to do a password reset but their account is not found in the Auth0 database. You will need to create a script which will call the `/accounts` endpoint of the Stormpath API, passing the user's email as the `email` parameter.

If successful, Stormpath will return a the user's information. You can extract the user's information and pass it to Auth0 in the callback function.

```js
function getByEmail(email, callback) {
  // Replace the YOUR-CLIENT-ID attribute with your Stormpath ID
  var url = 'https://api.stormpath.com/v1/applications/{YOUR-CLIENT-ID}/accounts';

  request({
    url: url,
    method: 'GET',
    auth: {
      // Your API Client ID
      user: '{STORMPATH-CLIENT-ID}',
      // YOUR API Client Secret
      password: '{STORMPATH-CLIENT-SECRET}'
    },
    qs: { q: email }
  }, function (error, response, body) {
    if (response.statusCode !== 200) return callback();

    var parsedBody = JSON.parse(body);
    var user = parsedBody.items[0];

    if (!user) return callback();

    var id = user.href.replace('https://api.stormpath.com/v1/accounts/', '');

    return callback(null, {
      user_id: id,
      username: user.username,
      email: user.email,
      email_verified: true,
      // Add any additional fields you would like to carry over from Stormpath
    });
  });
}
```

You can click the **Try** button above the script to test and see whether the script works.

## Testing the Custom Database Connection

At this point you can test the custom database connection to ensure that it works.

Click on **Try connection**:

![Try Connection](/media/articles/users/migrations/try-connection.png)

The Auth0 Lock widget will appear. Enter the email address and password for the Stormpath user, and click on **Log In**:

![Try Connection - Lock](/media/articles/users/migrations/try-connection-lock.png)

You should see a web page indicating that the connection works, with information about the user:

![Try Connection - Success](/media/articles/users/migrations/try-connection-success.png)

If you navigate to the [Users](${manage_url}/#/users) section in the Auth0 Dashboard, you will see the newly imported user listed:

![Imported User](/media/articles/users/migrations/user-imported.png)
