# Manage Users

Auth0's hosted cloud database stores a variety of information on your users that is accessible to you. This information is available to you via a *user profile*, and your users are grouped by tenant. The user information itself can come from a variety of sources, including identity providers, your own databases, and enterprise connections (Active Directory, <dfn data-key="security-assertion-markup-language">SAML</dfn>).
