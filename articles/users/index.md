# User Management

Auth0's hosted cloud database stores a variety of information on your users that is accessible to you. This information is available to you via a *user profile*, and your users are grouped by tenant. The user information itself can come from a variety of sources, including identity providers, your own databases, and enterprise connections (Active Directory, SAML).

## User profiles

Auth0 [user profiles](/users/concepts/overview-user-profile) contain information about your users such as name and contact information. Auth0 provides a variety of tools to help you manage user profiles such as the Dashboard and the Management API. You can create, search, view, and delete users. You can also define, manage, and store custom user profile attributes such as favorite color or location. To reconcile the formatting differences between various identity providers, you can normalize your user data.

## User metadata

Auth0 allows you to create, manage, and store [metadata](/users/concepts/overview-user-metadata) related to each user that has not come from an external data source. 

## Authorization Extension

The [Authorization Extension](/extensions/authorization-extension/v2) provides support for user authorization via Groups, Roles, and Permissions. You can define the expected behavior during the login process, and your configuration settings will be captured in a [rule](/rules) that is executed at runtime.

You can store authorization data like groups, roles, or permissions in the outgoing token issued by Auth0. Your application can then consume this information by inspecting the token and take appropriate actions based on the user's current authorization context. 

## Data storage

Auth0 stores user information for your tenant in a hosted cloud database, or you can choose to store user data in your own custom external database. Auth0 provides a [data storage example](/users/references/user-data-storage-scenario), so you can see how data storage works and also provides some [best practices](/best-practices/user-data-storage-best-practices). 

## User migration

Auth0 supports importing and exporting users from external applications and data sources using [automatic migration](/users/guides/configure-automatic-migration), the [Management API](/users/guides/bulk-user-imports), or the [User Import/Export Extension](/extensions/user-import-export).

## Redirect users

To make your login process as easy-to-use and seamless as possible, you'll need to keep track of where you want to route users inside your application once Auth0 [redirects](/users/guides/redirect-users-after-login) users back to your application after authentication and after they [log out](/logout/guides/redirect-users-after-logout). You can also [redirect users from rules](/rules/current/redirect).

## User search

Learn about how to [search](/users/search/v3) for users and sort, view, and export the search results using the Management API endpoints.
