# Identify Users

There are two recommended options to uniquely identify your users:

1. By the `user_id` property. This is guaranteed to be unique per user (such as `{identity provider id}|{unique id in the provider}`, or `facebook|1234567890`).
2. By a *natural* key, like the `email` property. In this case, it is recommended that you enable email verification and only use this option with providers that require that users verify their emails.

If you use [custom databases](/connections/database/mysql), you must return a unique `user_id` property. If you have multiple custom databases and expect possible collisions between ids from different connections, you should use a prefix identifying the connection. For example:

```javascript
function login (email, password, callback) {
  var user = getUserFromDB(email);
  var profile = {
    user_id: 'MyConnection1|' + user.id,
    email: user.email,
    [...]
  };
  callback(null, profile);
}
```
