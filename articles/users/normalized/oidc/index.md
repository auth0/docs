# User Profiles Returned from OIDC-Compliant Pipelines

::: version-warning
This article describes the user profile that includes only the [OpenID Connect standard claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims). Use the toggle for information on the Auth0 normalized profile, which might contain information from many identity providers.
:::

When you're using an OIDC-conformant authentication flow, the user profile you receive in return may differ slightly from the [Auth0 Normalized User Profile](/users/normalized).

The following is a [non-normative example of such a response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html#StandardClaims):

```json
  {
   "sub": "248289761001",
   "name": "Jane Doe",
   "given_name": "Jane",
   "family_name": "Doe",
   "middle_name": "",
   "nickname": "",
   "preferred_username": "j.doe",
   "profile": "",
   "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg",
   "website": "http://example.com",
   "email": "janedoe@example.com",
   "email_verified": true,
   "gender": "female",
   "birthdate": "",
   "zoneinfo": "",
   "locale": "",
   "phone_number": "",
   "phone_number_verified": false,
   "address": "",
   "updated_at": "",
  }
```

## Retrieve User Profiles using ID Tokens

You can retrieve the user profile by retrieving an ID Token using the Authentication API's [`oauth/token` endpoint](/api/authentication#get-token) or the [`/userinfo` endpoint](/api/authentication#get-user-info). Auth0's [Lock](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries#lock-login-signup-widgets) widget and the [Auth0 client-side SDKs](/libraries#auth0-client-side-sdks) also return the OIDC-compliant user profile.

Additionally, the User Profile section of our [QuickStarts](/quickstarts) return user profiles compliant with the OIDC specification. Some of our more popular QuickStarts are:

- [ASP.NET Core](/quickstart/webapp/aspnet-core/04-user-profile)
- [Android](/quickstart/native/android/04-user-profile)
- [Angular 2](/quickstart/spa/angular2/03-user-profile)
- [Node.js](/quickstart/webapp/nodejs)
- [React](/quickstart/spa/react/02-user-profile)
