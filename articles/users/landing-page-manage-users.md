## What can I do with Auth0?

Auth0 provides simple-to-use tools to help you [manage user identities](/users/microsite-manage-users-and-user-profiles) including adding, migrating, or removing users; modifying user profile and authorization attributes; and identifying root-cause login issues in minutes with a simple, intuitive and powerful web interface. 

## How can I connect users to my identify platform?

[Connect users to your identity platforms](/users/microsite-connect-users-to-your-identity-platform) using popular social media providers like Facebook and Twitter. Or, if your apps are within an enterprise, use SD, LDAP, SAML and more to authenticate users. You can create connections that don't require your users to remember passwords if that's your cup of tea. You can even specify which users have access to which apps. 

## How can I manage my user data?

There are a couple of ways that Auth0 can help you [define and maintain your user metadata](/users/microsite-maintain-user-metadata). You can use Auth0 Lock or the Management API depending on how complex your apps are and how much metadata you have. You can store users' credentials in Auth0's Data Store or in your own database. Depending on the method you choose, you can define, read, update, merge and delete metadata use Auth0 User Profiles in the Dashboard. You can also set up field naming rules and blacklist certain metadata.
