# User Search

User search allows you to retrieve user profile details using Auth0's [Management API](/api/management/v2). Search results can be [viewed](/users/search/v3/view-search-results-by-page), [sorted](/users/search/v3/sort-search-results), and [exported](/users/guides/bulk-user-exports).

::: note
Most user profile fields are not returned as part of an [ID Token](/tokens/id-token), nor are they included in the response from the [/userinfo endpoint](/api/authentication#get-user-info) of the Authentication API. 
:::

When searching for users in Auth0, you can use multiple endpoints to search for ID, email, or other criteria:

| Requirement | Endpoint to Use |
| - | - |
| Searches involving user attributes | [Get Users](/users/search/v3/get-users-endpoint) |
| Searches returning multiple users | [Get Users](/users/search/v3/get-users-endpoint) or [Get Users by Email](/users/search/v3/get-users-by-email-endpoint) |
| Operations requiring [immediate consistency](#search-result-terminology) | [Get Users by ID](/users/search/v3/get-users-by-id-endpoint) or [Get Users by Email](/users/search/v3/get-users-by-email-endpoint) |
| Actions requiring user search as part of authentication processes | [Get Users by ID](/users/search/v3/get-users-by-id-endpoint) or [Get Users by Email](/users/search/v3/get-users-by-email-endpoint) |
| Searching for users for account linking by email | [Get Users by Email](/users/search/v3/get-users-by-email-endpoint) |

::: note
User Search v3 is not available for the Private Cloud.

## Search Result Terminology

We use the following terms to describe the user search results:

* **Eventually consistent**: Search results may not reflect a recently-completed write operation. However, if you repeat your request after a short period of time, the response will return up-to-date data.

* **Immediately consistent**: Search results will reflect the results of all successful write operations, including those that occurred shortly prior to your request.
