# User Metadata

Auth0 provides you with **metadata** fields to store individual user information that did not originate with an identity provider. Auth0 distinguishes between two types of metadata:

* **User metadata**: used to store user attributes (e.g., user preferences) that do *not* impact a user's core functionality;
* **App metadata**: used to store information (e.g., a user's support plan, security roles, or access control groups) that can impact a user's core functionality, such as how an application functions or what the user can access.

::: note
An authenticated user can modify data in their profile's `user_metadata`, but not in their `app_metadata`.
:::

You can read, create, and edit user metadata using Rules, Auth0 APIs, and Lock.

### User Metadata Best Practices

* Both `app_metadata` and `user_metadata` are limited to a size of 16mb each. However, we recommend against using these properties like a database. They should be used for identity related information. Additionally, at some point we may put a more strict size limit on these properties. Please also be aware that using Rules and/or the Management Dashboard may further limit the amount of metadata you can store.

* An authenticated user can perform actions that modify data in their profile's **user_metadata**, but they can't do anything that modifies their **app_metadata**.

* Use a consistent datatype each time you create or update a given metadata field. Using `user.user_metadata.age = "23"` for one user and `user.user_metadata.age = 23` for another user will cause issues when retrieving the data.

## Rules

[Rules](/rules) are JavaScript functions executed as part of the Auth0 authentication process (prior to authorization). Using rules, you can read, create, or update user metadata and have such changes affect the results of the authorization process. 

For more information and examples refer to [User Metadata in Rules](/rules/current/metadata-in-rules).

## Auth0 APIs

When you use the [Authentication API](/api/authentication), you can use the [Signup](/api/authentication?shell#signup) endpoint to set the `user_metadata` for a user. **This endpoint only works for database connections.**

For an example of working with metadata during a custom signup process, see [Custom Signup > Using the API](/libraries/custom-signup#using-the-api).

:::note
You can also use the [GET /userinfo endpoint](/api/authentication#get-user-info) in order to get a user's `user_metadata`. To do so, you first have to [write a Rule to copy `user_metadata` properties to the ID Token](/rules#copy-user-metadata-to-id-token).
:::

You can use the [Management API](/api/management/v2) in order to retrieve, create, or update both the `user_metadata` and `app_metadata` fields at any point.

| **Endpoint** | **Description** |
|--|--|
| [Search user by id](/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users_by_id) | Use this if you want to search for a user based on Id. For an example request see [User Search](/users/search/best-practices#users-by-id). |
| [Search user by email](/api/management/v2#!/Users_By_Email/get_users_by_email) | Use this if you want to search for a user based on email. For an example request see [User Search](/users/search/best-practices#users-by-email).|
| [Get a list of users](/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users) | Use this if you want to search for a list if users with other search criteria. For an example request see [User Search](/best-practices/search-best-practices#users). See also [Export Metadata](/best-practices/search-best-practices#export-metadata) for limitations. |
| [Create User](/api/management/v2#!/Users/post_users) | Create a new user and (optionally) set metadata. For a body sample see [POST /api/v2/users](/api/management/v2#!/Users/post_users).|
| [Update User](/api/management/v2#!/Users/patch_users_by_id) | Update a user using a JSON object. For example requests see [PATCH /api/v2/users/{id}](/api/management/v2#!/Users/patch_users_by_id).|

## Metadata usage

Suppose the following metadata is stored for a user with the email address `jane.doe@example.com`:

```json
{
    "emails": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "user_metadata": {
        "hobby": "surfing"
    },
    "app_metadata": {
        "plan": "full"
    }
}
```

::: note
Any valid JSON snippet can be used as metadata.
:::

To read metadata, simply access the correct property as you would from any JSON object. For example, if you were working with the above example metadata within a [Rule](/rules) or via a call to the Management API, you could reference specific items from the data set as follows:

```js
console.log(user.email); // "jane.doe@example.com"
console.log(user.user_metadata.hobby); // "surfing"
console.log(user.app_metadata.plan); // "full"
```

::: note
With Management APIv1, all metadata was stored in the `metadata` field. Data stored in this field is now available under `app_metadata`.
:::

## Metadata and custom databases

If you are using a [custom database](/connections/database#using-your-own-user-store), the **app_metadata** field should be referred to as **metadata** in the scripts you run to manage your metadata.

For example, you would *not* use this:

```json
{
    "emails": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "user_metadata": {
        "hobby": "surfing"
    },
    "app_metadata": {
        "plan": "full"
    }
}
```

Instead, you would use this:

```json
{
    "emails": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "user_metadata": {
        "hobby": "surfing"
    },
    "metadata": {
        "plan": "full"
    }
}
```
