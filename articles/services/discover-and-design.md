# Discover & Design

The first stage in a successful implementation involves discovering, designing, and architecting your Identity and Access Management solution, and our Discover & Design services are here to help. We work together with your product and engineering teams to **architect an Identity solution** for your environment and build an **incremental Go-Live plan** that solves the most-pressing identity problems early. Auth0 Professional Services help your projects quickly reach success by addressing your business objectives in a pragmatic, step-by-step manner.
