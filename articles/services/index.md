## How Professional Services can help you with your project

### IAM solution design & architecture

Customers buy software to solve a business problem. The longer the implementation takes, the longer that business problem remains unsolved. If implementation stalls or fails, it’s a lost opportunity and a major additional cost both for you and for Auth0. Or in the worst case, it becomes an even bigger security issue or legal issue. This is why it is of the utmost importance to plan, design, and implement your IAM solution securely, effectively, and expediently. This is where Auth0 Professional Services (PS) come in. 

The first step in a successful implementation is architecting your Identity and Access Management solution. We work together with your product and engineering teams to **architect an Identity solution** for your environment and build an **incremental Go-Live plan** that solves the most-pressing identity problems early. Auth0 Professional Services help your project reach success quickly and address your business objectives in a pragmatic, stepwise manner. 

PS Solutions Architects have decades of combined industry expertise and Auth0-specific training. We have delivered **thousands of successful IAM projects and integrations**. Let us help you steer clear of costly security pitfalls and build a solid foundation for your identity needs, while reducing risk.

### Get to production faster

We can consolidate all the enablement activities leading to a successful adoption into three major milestones or phases:

1. Solution discovery and architecture 
2. Initial Go-Live 
3. Advanced Go-Live

In the discovery phase, our Solution Architects will work with your teams to identify the core goals, features, and functionality that constitute your successful IAM implementation. We will also uncover any legacy architectural issues or requirements that may need more careful consideration.

The initial Go-Live milestone is designed to be impactful enough to make material differences in the overall Identity project. At the same time, it is limited enough that it can be reached quickly&mdash;ideally within 30 days of the project start&mdash;to keep the positive momentum. The initial Go-Live typically includes migration off a legacy IDP, must-have features, and possibly a subset of all applications.

The last milestone, Advanced Go-Live, can be broken into multiple sub-milestones, especially if you have multiple applications or development teams. This helps manage the complexity of a large project and achieves incremental and steady progress. 

The goal of a Professional Services engagement is to identify, document, and build consensus with you on these milestones as the path to successful Auth0 adoption. 

If any part of your project requires more specialized attention and implementation assistance from an Auth0 Solution Architect, we may position additional Professional Services to help you reach that milestone.

### Accelerate your custom implementation

Auth0 is a unique service that offers developers unrivaled flexibility and extensibility. Our expert Professional Services team knows how to extend Auth0 in the ways that are most optimal for the platform and for your environment.

In addition to enablement activities, Professional Services provides **custom implementation services**.

Solutions that Professional Services can deliver to help you achieve the product functionality, service connectivity, operational readiness, and/or quality assurance you require to get to production include: 

* **Custom rules, hooks, DB scripts, login pages, and email templates:** Solve a user experience, 3rd-party service integration, or other logical problem within a customer’s Auth0 authentication and authorization workflow. These customizations happen in-product and do not require additional infrastructure to deploy.

* **Custom endpoints and libraries:** Solve a service communication, user experience, or tenant management problem through the use of a custom web services endpoint or code library. Typically deployed on customer or third-party infrastructure.

* **Custom utilities:** Solve a quality assurance or operations problem that is out-of-band from extending core product functionality, such as performance testing or deployment scripts.

* **Custom code samples:** Demonstrate how a developer integrates with Auth0 using a specific language or technology stack. Used primarily for education.

### Maintain and improve your IAM solution

Once the implementation is complete, we will work with your teams to review your Identity environment, optimize and improve your solution, introduce new features, and answer any questions. To support this effort, we recommend scheduling an annual HealthCheck engagement.  

For our larger customers, we also provide our post-implementation consulting service. Auth0’s “Premier Success” offering assigns a dedicated Solutions Architect to meet with your team on a weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly basis to help maintain and improve your Auth0 solution. 
 
_We provide continuous education and knowledge transfer throughout the engagement._
