# Professional Service Packages

Auth0 Professional Services provides packaged offerings designed to optimize our customers' investments in Auth0. Packaged offerings generally fall into two main categories: Discover, Architect, Design, and Implement packages, together with Maintain and Improve packages, and are all based on proven best practices designed to help customers avoid common pitfalls and reduce risk. 

Auth0 Professional Services packages can be consumed in a mix-and-match fashion to provide you with expert help as and when you need it: take a Discovery Workshop followed by a Basic or Standard package, or opt for a Standard or an Advanced Package from the start, the choice is your. To get more information and to order any of these service packages, please contact your Auth0 Account Representative.

## Discover, Architect, Design, and Implement packages
