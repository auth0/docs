# Advisory Sessions: Pair Programming

Auth0 engineers will join the customer development teams during initial phases of development, under a pair-programming mode, focusing on Auth0 related code and integration points. The goal is to speed-up development and mitigate risks.

## Estimated effort

Time-boxed working sessions based on customer requirements with an Auth0 Solutions Architect and customer's development team.

## Typical work-streams

* **Pair-programming sessions:** co-implement with customer development teams, common authentication flows using Auth0.


## Deliverables

* Jointly developed code.
