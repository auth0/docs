# Custom Implementation

In addition to enablement activities, Professional Services provides **custom implementation services** to help you accelerate your integration with Auth0. Auth0 is a unique service that offers developers unrivaled flexibility and extensibility, and our expert Professional Services team knows how to extend Auth0 in ways that are the most optimal for the platform and for your environment.

Professional Services can provide a wide range of custom implementation to help you achieve the product functionality, service connectivity, operational readiness, and/or quality assurance you require to get to production. This includes: 

* **Custom rules, hooks, DB scripts, login pages, and email templates:** Solve a user experience, 3rd-party service integration, or other logical problem within a customerâ€™s Auth0 authentication and authorization workflow. These customizations happen in-product and do not require additional infrastructure to deploy.

* **Custom endpoints and libraries:** Solve a service communication, user experience, or tenant management problem through the use of a custom web services endpoint or code library. Typically deployed on customer or third-party infrastructure.

* **Custom utilities:** Solve a quality assurance or operations problem that is out-of-band from extending core product functionality, such as performance testing or deployment scripts.

* **Custom code samples:** Demonstrate how a developer integrates with Auth0 using a specific language or technology stack. Used primarily for education.
