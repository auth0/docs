# Advisory Sessions: Scenario guidance

An offering to help customers address specific requirements related to a current project that is expected to use Auth0. This service is applicable in all phases of a product lifecycle, delivered remotely in a variety of ways (such as technology briefings, Q&A sessions, and so on).

## Estimated effort

Includes up to three (3) working sessions, where we will jointly draft a high-level solution to address the requirements of your scenario with an Auth0 Solutions Architect. We will provide a recommendations memo afterwards for your reference.

Diagrams or information you deem relevant should be provided prior to this engagement so that we can optimize the time available.


## Typical work-streams

* **Working sessions:** review requirements, jointly discuss architecture solution. Document findings and agreements.

## Deliverables

* Technical document: infrastructure decisions, requirements, setup details, processes, simulation details.
