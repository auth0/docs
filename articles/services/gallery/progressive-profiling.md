# Progressive Profiling

Customers quite often decide to collect additional information at signup, as they feel it's easier to implement. The reality is quite often to the contrary: whilst it's easy to add custom signup fields to, say, Lock, once the user has signed up there's no way to use this interface to collect any additional information. So unless the additional signup fields are mandatory, collecting additional information in the actual signup form means that the opportunity to collect could be lost. This is where Progressive Profiling can be the better option.

Progressive profiling aims to speed up user onboarding by reducing the amount of data that the users have to enter in the registration form. Additionally it can be used to capture additional data from existing users and for users logging in through federated identity providers.
