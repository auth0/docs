# System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM)

[SCIM](http://www.simplecloud.info/) - the System for Cross-domain Identity Management - is a standardized protocol and schema for provisioning, deprovisioning, and managing user identity-related information across systems. If you are developing a cloud application or service that is intended to be used by one or more enterprise organizations, SCIM provides a standardized way for these organizations to programmatically provision, deprovision, and manage their user account records in your application. 

Customized extensibility provided by the Auth0 Professional Services team allows you to quickly implement and deploy to production SCIM 2.0-based user provisioning, deprovisioning, and management for any application using Auth0 as its user identity front end. We achieve this by implementing a customized SCIM 2.0 server that translates all SCIM messages into the format required by the Users endpoint of the Auth0 management API.

Whether you're a B2B SaaS application developer selling to large enterprise organizations, or a B2E developer building cloud applications that need to integrate with your organization's identity provisioning and governance systems, the Auth0 Professional Services team can assist you with:

* Support for all SCIM 2.0 operation types (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) for Users
* Compatibility with popular identity provisioning products that support SCIM 2.0
* Inbound and outbound user provisioning from Auth0 user databases
* Account linking between federated identity providers and provisioned users
* Multi-tenant and single-tenant architectures
* Training and education on common patterns and pitfalls
