# Discover

Discovery is at the heart of what we do: if you've never engaged with Professional Services on a project before then Discovery is typically where we start. Discovery is specifically designed to help us, help you, understand what's required for sucessfull integration with Auth0. Conducted as a series of [Architectural Discovery](/services/architect-and-design#architectural-discovery) and [Scenario Guidance](/services/architect-and-design#scenario-guidance) sessions, we typically work with you and your team(s) on-site, to identify critical use case scenarios and begin building solution design. 

Why Discovery? Identifying your primary objectives early will help you and your team(s) focus on the specifics important to building out your solution, and our Discovery process provides an oppertunity to work with one of our Solutions Architects in a focused and immersive manner. Typically conducted on-site, and captured in a bespoke [Discovery Report](#discovery-report) that's backed by beskoke [Planning Guidance](#planning-guidance), we'll help you understand what you need to consider in order to bring your project(s) to market in the most effective manner.

## Delivery

Discovery is delivered as an optional part of many of the [packages](/services/packages) available from Auth0 Professional Services. Our [Discovery Workshop](/services/packages#-discovery-workshop-), for example, provides for just Discovery and nothing more. Our [Basic package](/services/packages#-basic-package-) on the other hand, provides access to Discovery whilst also giving you the oppertunity to leverage services such as [Programming Advisory](/services/implement#programming-advisory) and [Deployment Preparation](/services/implement#deployment-preparation). Whilst our [Standard](/services/packages#-standard-package-) and [Advanced](/services/packages#-advanced-package-) packages offer the most comprehensive range of services (including Discovery) in the most cost effective manner. Whichever package you choose, Discovery comes as standard.   

## Documentation

Discovery documentation provides you with a comprehensive view regarding your integration with Auth0. A [Discovery Report](#discovery-report) describes what you need to consider as part of your integration, and acts as a baseline going forward: projects typically benefit from more than just a single Discovery, and your report is typically where details are captured as you engage with Professional Services and beyond. [Planning Guidance](#planning-guidance) offers you a perspective on how to tackle your integration, and provides an at-a-glance view regarding which topics to address and when to address them. For more details on both of these, and to see what might be part of your Discovery, feel free to take a look at the examples provided below.

A Discovery Report provides you with bespoke and tailored guidance. The report is designed to be a living document: it will grow, be refined, and acts as a collaborative tool to provide project specifc best practice as well as the base line reference for your Auth0 integration - whether part of a Professional Services engagement or beyond. The Discovery Report also provides recommendations for immediate review, as well as providing you with at-a-glance reference to general purpose Auth0 [Business to Consumer (B2C)](/architecture-scenarios/b2c) and [Business to Business (B2B)](/architecture-scenarios/b2b) Identity and Access Management guidance - as and when you need it.

Project Planning Guidance provides you with a bespoke plan for tackling your integration with Auth0. Based
on real world customer implementation experience, but targeted to your specific requirements, your guide provides you with the goals and objectives you need to plan for, and in the order they need to be considered. Planning Guidance distills our experience, in conjunction with your project needs, to help you deliver your solution in the most effective manner, and links directly to your Discovery Report to provide access to bespoke, tailred guidance exactly when you need it.
