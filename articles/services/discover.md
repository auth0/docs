# Discover

Discovery is at the heart of what we do: if you've never engaged with Professional Services on a project before then Discovery is typically where we start. Discovery is specifically designed to help us, help you, understand what's required for sucessfull integration with Auth0. Conducted as a series of [Architectural Discovery](/services/architect-and-design#architectural-discovery) and [Scenario Guidance](/services/architect-and-design#scenario-guidance) sessions, we typically work with you and your team(s) on-site, to identify critical use case scenarios and begin building solution design. 

Why Discovery? Identifying your primary objectives early will help you and your team(s) focus on the specifics important to building out your solution, and our Discovery process provides an oppertunity to work with one of our Solutions Architects in a focused and immersive manner. Typically conducted on-site, and captured in a bespoke [Discovery Report](#discovery-report) that's backed by beskoke [Planning Guidance](#planning-guidance), we'll help you understand what you need to consider in order to bring your project(s) to market in the most effective manner.

## Execution

We provide Discovery as part of the [packages](/services/packages) available from Auth0 Professional Services. Our [Discovery Workshop](/services/packages#-discovery-workshop-), for example, provides just a Discovery option - giving you access to guidance from an Auth0 Solutions Architect and nothing more. Our a [Basic package]() on the other hand, provides access to Discovery whilst also giving you the oppertunity to leverage services such as . Whilst our Standard and Advanced packages. Whichever package you choose, Discovery comes as a standard option, and you can always mix-and-match 

 engage with Professional Services beyond a Discovery Workshop, and whichever option you choose the results of Discovery are captured in your own bespoke and uniquely tailored [Discovery Documentation](#documentation).   

## Documentation

Discovery documentation comes in a numnber of forms, that complement to provide you with a comprehensive view regarding your integration with Auth0. A [Discovery Report](#discovery-report) describes what you need to consider as part of your integration, and acts as a baseline going forward: projects typically benefit from more than just Discovery, and your report is typically where the details are captured as you engage with Professional Services and beyond. [Planning Guidance](#planning-guidance) offers you a perspective on how to tackle your integration, and provides at-a-glance view regarding which topics to address and when to address them. For more details on both of these, and to see what might be part of your Discovery, please feel free to look at the examples provided below.

A Discovery Report provides you with bespoke and tailored guidance. The report is designed to be a living document: it will grow, be refined, and acts as a collaborative tool to provide project specifc best practice as well as the base line reference for your Auth0 integration - whether part of a Professional Services engagement or beyond. The Discovery Report also provides recommendations for immediate review, as well as providing you with at-a-glance reference to general purpose Auth0 [Business to Consumer (B2C)](/architecture-scenarios/b2c) and [Business to Business (B2B)](/architecture-scenarios/b2b) Identity and Access Management guidance - as and when you need it.
