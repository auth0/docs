# AWS API Gateway Tutorial, Part 1: Create an Auth0 API

You will need to configure the APIs consumed by the applications that successfully authorize. You can do so using the [APIs section of the Management Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/apis).

Click **Create API** to create a new API for your integration.

You'll be asked to provide values for the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| - | - |
| Name | A friendly name for your API. This is the name you'll see in your list of Auth0 APIs |
| Identifier | A logical identifier for your API (we recommend formatting this identifier like a URL `https://your-api-gateway`) |
| Signing Algorithm | The algorithm you want Auth0 to use to sign the issued Access Tokens |

Click **Create** to proceed.

You can refer to the **Settings** page for the details of your newly-created API.

Creating an API also creates a Machine to Machine Application for use with the API. You can see this application listed as **Authorized** under the **Machine to Machine Application** tab. Additionally, you might want to make note of the Client ID, since you will need it in [Part 3](/integrations/aws-api-gateway/custom-authorizers/part-3) of this tutorial.
