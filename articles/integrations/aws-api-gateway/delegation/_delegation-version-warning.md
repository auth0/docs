::: version-warning
This feature uses delegation. By default, delegation is disabled for tenants without an add-on in use as of 8 June 2017. If you are not already using delegation, please use the drop-down to learn how to implement custom authorizers instead.

Legacy tenants who currently use an add-on that requires delegation may continue to use this feature. If delegation functionality is changed or removed from service at some point, customers who currently use it will be notified beforehand and given ample time to migrate.
