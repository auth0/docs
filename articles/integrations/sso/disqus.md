# Disqus Single Sign On Integration

Disqus allows you to embed a discussion section onto your site where your users can enter comments and interact with you and your other visitors. By implementing a Single Sign On (SSO) integration between Disqus and Auth0, users that have signed in and authenticated via Auth0 can leave comments as themselves in your Disqus discussion section.

## Install and Configure Disqus

1. If you don't already have an account with Disqus, create one. If you do, log in.
2. Select the **I want to install Disqus on my site** box.

3. You will be directed to the *Create a new site* page. Provide your **Website Name** and your website's **Category**. When you've provided the requested information, click **Create Site** to continue.

  ::: note
  You **Website Name** will become your unique Disqus URL. Make note of this URL, since it is required to configure your Auth0 Application.

4. Select your site's platform to receive customized instructions on installing Disqus and embedding its UI onto your site. If the platform you're using isn't listed, select **I don't see my platform, install manually with Universal Code** at the bottom of the page.

  When you have finished the installation process, click **Configure** to move on to the next step.

5. Configure your Disqus installation by providing the requested information about your website. When done (or if you want to complete this at a later time using the *Settings* page), click **Complete Setup**.

## Enable and Configure Single Sign On with Disqus

Once you have installed and configured your Disqus instance, you need to enable Single Sign On.

::: warning
A Disqus Pro level subscription is required to use the [Disqus Single Sign-On (SSO) add-on](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/236206-integrating-single-sign-on).
:::

1. Navigate to the [Applications section of the Disqus API](https://disqus.com/api/applications/) to register your application.

2. Provide the requested details about your application. When complete, click **Register my application**.

  ![](/media/articles/integrations/disqus/register.png)

3. You will now see your Auth0 application listed in the Disqus Applications panel.

  ![](/media/articles/integrations/disqus/register-api-app.png)

4. Click on the [Single Sign-On](https://disqus.com/api/sso/) tab to go to the SSO management area where you will configure your remote domain and test the payload you create. Provide the following for your integration:

  * **Name**: the name used to identify your domain
  * **Slug**: the prefixed value for your account

  **Notes**:

  * Refrain from using any non-alphanumeric characters to prevent conflicts from happening. * The name assigned to your remote domain is permanent and non-transferable.
  * You can have only one remote domain per user account, and you should use a single remote domain per site (created using the moderator account).

  Click **Save Changes** when you're done.

5. Return to the *Settings* page of the *Applications* tab.
6. Scroll to the *Settings* section and provide the following information:

  * **Domains**: the domain(s) of the site in which you've embedded Disqus;
  * **SSO Domain**: the Disqus account for which you have SSO enabled.

  Under the *Authentication* section, provide the following information:

  * **Default Access**: Set to *Read and Write*.

  When done, click **Save Changes**.

6. At this point, SSO is fully configured for your Disqus account. You will now need to [finish configuring the integration](https://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/236206-single-sign-on) from the Auth0 side.

## Integrate Disqus with Auth0

At this point, you will embed code onto your site that will generate a secured message that is passed to Disqus.

When you are signed in to Auth0, you have user information including (but not limited to):

* `user_id`;
* `username`;
* `displayName`.

You can host [server-side code](https://github.com/disqus/DISQUS-API-Recipes/tree/master/sso) that generates the secure authentication message to pass the user's data to Disqus. This message contains three parts, each of which is separated with a single whitespace character:

* The message body in a JSON-serialized form;
* The HMA-SHA1 signature;
* The timestamp of the message.

You can host this code server-side as a Node service that's protected by Auth0 so that only authorized entities can access it.

```js
var JSON = require('json3');
var CryptoJS = require("crypto-js");
var DISQUS_SECRET = "disqus_secret";
var DISQUS_PUBLIC = "disqus_public";
var data = disqusSignon();


function disqusSignon() {
  var disqusData = {
    id: "auth0|577d19a858dd4da46509080'",
    username: "test1234@gmail.com",
    email: "test1234@gmail.com"
  };

  var disqusStr = JSON.stringify(disqusData);

  var timestamp = Math.round(+new Date() / 1000);

  var message = new Buffer(disqusStr).toString('base64');

  /*
   * CryptoJS (included in the directory) is required for hashing
   * https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/
   */

  var result = CryptoJS.HmacSHA1(message + " " + timestamp, DISQUS_SECRET);
  var hexsig = CryptoJS.enc.Hex.stringify(result);

  return {
    pubKey: DISQUS_PUBLIC,
    auth: message + " " + hexsig + " " + timestamp
  };
}
```

To complete the integration and pass the authentication data to Disqus, you'll need to add user-related entries to the `disqus_config` variable in your app's code.

```js
var disqus_config = function() {
  // Replace PAGE_URL with your page's canonical URL variable
  this.page.url = 'http://PAGE_URL.disqus.com';
  this.page.identifier = '1234567';
  this.page.title = 'Landing Page'

  //Call the Node.js service to get auth data for user

  /*
  var user = {
    pubKey : 'PUBLIC_KEY',
    auth : message + " " + hexsig + " " + timestamp
  }
  */

  this.page.remote_auth_s3 = user.auth;
  this.page.api_key = user.pubKey;
};
```

At this point, you will see the option to SSO using Disqus when authenticating in to your app.
