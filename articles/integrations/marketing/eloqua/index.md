# Export User Data To Oracle Eloqua

In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to export user data in Auth0 to a CSV file then import it into Eloqua with the contact upload wizard.

## Create a user data file

Start by navigating to the [Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions) section of the Dashboard and open the **User Import / Export Extension**. On the extension page, select **Export** from the menu.

Next, set the **Export Format** to the required file format. Eloqua accepts file imports in CSV format so choose the `Tab Separated Value file (*.csv)` option.

User Field | Column Name
-----------|------------
`email` | Email Address
`created_at` | Created At
`given_name` | First Name
`family_name` | Last Name
