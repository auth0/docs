## Import Users to Alterian

To import your Auth0 users into Alterian:

- Export your user data as a CSV file with the [User Import / Export Extension](/extensions/user-import-export).
- Import the file into Alterian with the Campaign Manager's Data Import tool.

### Create a User Data File

Start by navigating to the [Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions) section of the Dashboard and open the **User Import / Export Extension**. On the extension page, select **Export** from the menu.

Next, set the **Export Format** to the required file format. Alterian accepts file imports in CSV format so choose the `Tab Separated Value file (*.csv)` option.

At the top in the **Fields** section, provide a **User Field** and **Column Name** for each user attribute to include in the export. For example:

User Field | Column Name
-----------|------------
`email` | Email Address
`created_at` | Created At
`given_name` | First Name
`family_name` | Last Name
