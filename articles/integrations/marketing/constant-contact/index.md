# Export User Data To Constant Contact

In this article, youâ€™ll learn how to export user data in Auth0 to a CSV file then import it into the Constant Contact dashboard.

## Create a user data file

Start by navigating to the [Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions) section of the Dashboard and open the **User Import / Export Extension**. On the extension page, select **Export** from the menu.

Next, set the **Export Format** to the required file format. Constant Contact accepts file imports in CSV format so choose the `Tab Separated Value file (*.csv)` option.
