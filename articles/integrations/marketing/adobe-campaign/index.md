# Adobe Campaign Integration

## Import Users to Adobe Campaign

To import your Auth0 users into Adobe Campaign:

- Export your user data as a CSV file with the [User Import / Export Extension](/extensions/user-import-export).
- Import the file into Adobe Campaign with the [Adobe Campaign Import Wizard](https://docs.campaign.adobe.com/doc/AC/en/PTF_Importing-Exporting_data_About_generic_import_and_export.html).

### Create a User Data File

Start by navigating to the [Extensions](${manage_url}/#/extensions) section of the Dashboard and open the **User Import / Export Extension**. On the extension page, select **Export** from the menu.

Next, set the **Export Format** to the required file format. Adobe Campaign accepts file imports in CSV format so choose the `Tab Separated Value file (*.csv)` option.

At the top in the **Fields** section, provide a **User Field** and **Column Name** for each user attribute to include in the export. For example:

User Field | Column Name
-----------|------------
`email` | Email Address
`created_at` | Created At
`given_name` | First Name
`family_name` | Last Name

After adding the user fields, click on the **Export Users** button to start the export. Once the export is complete, download the CSV file to use in the following section.

Log in to your Adobe Campaign client dashboard and navigate to **Profiles and Targets > Jobs**. Create a new import job by clicking the **Create** button and selecting **New Import**.

A new **Import Wizard** window should open. On the **Template Selection** step you can set your import parameters.

Parameter | Description

Import template (leave as default) | The job template, set to `New text import` by default.
Label | A label for the job, for example: `Importing Auth0 users`.

Once you've configured your import parameters, click the **Next** button to continue.

On the **File to Import** step upload the user data CSV file you exported from Auth0 in the previous section. Click the **Next** button to proceed to **Field Mapping**.

Next, map the export file schema to your Adobe Campaign database schema. Check that the field names and field types are correct, then click the **Next** button.
