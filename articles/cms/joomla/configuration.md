# Joomla Integration

Before you can use Auth0 to handle authentication and authorization requests for your Joomla users, you'll need to do some configuration from both sides of the integration.

## Configure Application Values

To use Auth0 with Joomla, be sure you have a valid [Application](/applications). You'll need to provide information about your application to the Auth0-Joomla extension you [installed](/cms/joomla/installation).

1. Log in to the Joomla Control Panel using an admin account. Using the top navigation bar, go to **Components > Auth0 > Auth0**. Click **Options** (located in the top right of the window).

2. Provide the requested values for your Auth0 application. You can find the **Domain**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** values using the the [Application Settings page](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings). Click **Save & Close** to proceed.

3. On the left-hand side, select **Test** (if you're not automatically redirected to the page). Make sure that the **Auth0 App Data** setting indicates **Complete**.

3. Click on the name of the module `Auth0` to launch the settings page. On the right-hand side, use the **Position** drop-down menu to indicate [where the Auth0 Login button will be located](https://docs.joomla.org/Module_Position) on your site.

4. Switch over the the **Menu Assignment** tab, and using the **Module Assignment** drop-down menu, select **On all pages**.

5. Click **Save & Close**. The Auth0 Login button will now appear in the location you selected on your Joomla pages. Whenever a user clicks **Login**, they will see the [Auth0 Lock widget](/libraries/lock).

You can configure your Auth0-Joomla Extension by adjusting the **Module** and **Advanced** Settings.
