# Joomla Configuration

## Component configuration
The first thing you will need to do, is to set up your *Auth0 Domain*, *Client Id* and *Client Secret* in your content configuration.

So, go to your account and under the [Apps section](${uiURL}/#/applications) and access to the setting of the app you want to use (or create a new one). If you don't have an account, create one [here](https://auth0.com) and the create a new app.

1. Access the Auth0 component page.
2. Complete your *Auth0 Domain*, *Client Id* and *Client Secret*.
3. Click on *Save & Close*.
4. Click on the *Test* menu option to check it everything is ok.
