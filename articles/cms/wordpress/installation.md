::: note
In order to install or customize plugins, you will need to use a self-hosted WordPress.org site. Using the WordPress.com site does not allow installing plugins.
:::

There are two ways to install the Login by Auth0 WordPress plugin:

- Installing via the [WordPress Store](#installing-via-the-wordpress-store)
- Uploading the [`wp-auth0` folder](#manually-uploading-the-plugin-file) to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory

## Installing via the WordPress Store

While logged in as an administrator of your WordPress installation, go to the **Plugins** menu item.

Once the installation completes, click **Activate Plugin**.
