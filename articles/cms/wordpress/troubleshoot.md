# WordPress Troubleshooting

## The Auth0 settings page in WordPress displays the warning: "The current user is not authorized to manage the Auth0 account...".

If you updated your plugin to version 2 or configured the plugin without following the Quick Start Guide, you may need to provide an API token that the plugin will use to update your account settings. You can [generate a new token](/api/v2) and enter it into the **App Token** field of the the **Basic** settings page of the plugin. (The required scopes for the token are listed there.) You can also ignore this warning. Some operations will not be available from the plugin (like enabling rules or SSO). You will need to make these configuration changes manually in the [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}/#/clients).

## My configuration is wrong and I can't authenticate using Auth0. Is there another way to access the plugin?

The plugin can be accessed using valid WordPress credentials through the regular WordPress login by adding `?wle` to the login url. For example: `http://yourdomain.com/wp-login.php?wle`.

## I am having problems when a user logs in. Where can I find a log of what is happening?

The plugin provides an error log where you can check what has happened. Access it through the **Error Log** sub-item of the **Auth0** plugin menu.

## How can I show the widget or shortcode in signup mode as default?

You can use the widget `Extra configuration` setting (or the `extra_conf` attribute in the shortcode) and add this json `{"mode":"signup" }` that will force the plugin to be shown in this mode.

## When using a plugin to force the login, the user is not logged in.

Be sure to **whitelist** the Auth0 `callback_url`.

### The user is not logged in when using the `wp-force-login` plugin.

This is because the callback URL has not been whitelisted. Try adding this code to the `my_forcelogin_whitelist` filter:

```php
function my_forcelogin_whitelist( $whitelist ) {

...

  if( $_GET['auth0'] == 1 ) {
    $whitelist[] = site_url($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);
  }

...

  return $whitelist;
}
add_filter('v_forcelogin_whitelist', 'my_forcelogin_whitelist', 10, 1);
```

## How can I redirect the users to a certain URL after login?

### On the login page

This plugin leverages WordPress features to work seamless with default settings. To add a redirect, you can append the `redirect_to` query parameter to the URL when you direct the user to the login page. The plugin will redirect the user to this URL after a successful login.

You can also use the **Login redirection URL** setting in the Auth0 plugin settings page. This will URL be used to redirect the user when the `redirect_to` parameter is not provided.

### Using the widget

The widget will automatically redirect to the same page where the user was before authentication. You can override this using the `Redirect after login:` setting.

### Using the shortcode

The shortcode will automatically redirect to the same page where the user was before authentication. You can override this using the `redirect_to` attribute.

## How can I migrate my WordPress users to Auth0?

The current version of the plugin does not provide a way to automatically migrate users to Auth0, but you have a few options:

- The plugin exposes two endpoints to mark your custom database connection for **import to Auth0** mode as described in [Import users to Auth0](/connections/database/migrating). You can use these [plugin scripts](https://github.com/auth0/wp-auth0/blob/master/lib/WP_Auth0_CustomDBLib.php) to setup your connection.

- Export your user data to a JSON file and upload it for batch-import into Auth0. Initially, your users will have to reset their passwords when logging in using Auth0 because there is no way for Auth0 to decrypt the WordPress passwords during migration. To generate the JSON file, follow the instructions at [Mass-importing users to Auth0](/bulk-import). Then you will need to upload the file using the [Import users](/api/v2#!/Jobs/post_users_imports) endpoint.

- Use the [WordPress XML RPC](https://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support) endpoint to setup the migration flow using a custom database connection as described in [Import users to Auth0](/connections/database/migrating) with [this script](https://gist.github.com/glena/b31716e3c8fe48927be2).


## Database migration does not work

Your server needs to allow inbound connections from Auth0.

## The session expires too soon

The Auth0 plugin does not handle sessions, it uses the WordPress settings. By default, user sessions are kept alive for 2 days. You can enable the `Remember users session` setting to allow sessions to remain live for up to 14 hours.

::: note
This plugin leverages WordPress session handling and uses [wp_set_auth_cookie()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_set_auth_cookie/) to create the session cookie. This setting will send `true` as a second parameter to allow the session to last longer.
