description: How to configure WordPress as a application with Auth0.
---

# Configuration of the Login by Auth0 WordPress Plugin

By default, new installations of Login by Auth0 run the Setup Wizard and ask for an app token and attempt to setup all necessary components within your Auth0 tenant. This includes:

* Creating a new Application using your site name with the correct app type and URLs 
* Creating a database Connection for this Application for storing users
* Creating a Application grant for the system Auth0 Management API
* Creating a new user for the WordPress administrator running the wizard

Once this process is complete, your tenant is set up correctly and ready to accept signups and logins. 

The Setup Wizard must run to completion for your site to be setup correctly. If the Wizard fails for any reason before the "setup successful" screen, check the plugin error log at **wp-admin > Auth0 > Error Log** and the steps below to determine the issue. 

It can be helpful, if you're having any issues with logging in or creating accounts, to walk through the screens for each section below to confirm your setup. 

You'll need to be logged into your Auth0 account before starting the steps below. If you don't have one yet, [create one here](https://auth0.com/signup).

## Auth0 configuration

### Application setup

First, we'll check for the Application created for your WordPress site. 

1. Navigate to the [Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications) page and look for an Application that is similar to your site name; if you don't find one, it means that an Application was not created by the Wizard. Restart the Setup Wizard or create a new Application manually by clicking Create Application**, entering a name for the Application, selecting **Regular Web Applications**, then clicking **Create**. 
    
    ![Listing of Auth0 Applications in the Management Dashboard](/media/articles/cms/wordpress/client-listing.png)

1. Click on the name to get to the **Settings** tab. You will see your Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret, which are used in **wp-admin > Auth0 > Settings** to make a connection to Auth0

    ![Application Settings](/media/articles/cms/wordpress/auth0-client-settings.png)

1. **Application Type** must be set to **Regular Web Application**

1. Scroll down to **Allowed Callback URLs** and input your WordPress site's homepage URL, login URL, and index.php URL with `?auth0=1` appended to it, separated by a comma. It should look like this:

    ![Application - allowed callback field](/media/articles/cms/wordpress/client-allowed-callbacks.png)

1. Enter your WordPress site's home domain (where the WordPress site appears) and, if different, site domain (where wp-admin is served from) in the **Allowed Web Origins** field

1. Enter your WordPress site's login URL in the **Allowed Logout URLs** field

1. Leave the **Allowed Origins (CORS)** field blank (it will use the **Allowed Callback URLs** values from above)

    ::: note
    Make sure to match your site's protocol (http or https) and use the site URL as a base, found in **wp-admin > Settings > General > WordPress Address (URL)** for all URL fields above.
    :::

1. Scroll down and click the **Show Advanced Settings** link, then the **OAuth** tab and make sure **JsonWebToken Signature Algorithm** is set to RS256. If this needs to be changed later, it should be changed here as well as in wp-admin (see Settings > Basic below).

1. Turn off **OIDC Conformant**.

    ![Application - Advanced Settings - OAuth](/media/articles/cms/wordpress/client-advanced-settings.png)

1. Click the **Grant Types** tab and select at least **Implicit,** **Authorization Code,** **Refresh Token,** and 
**Client Credentials**.

    ![Application - Advanced Settings - Grant Types](/media/articles/cms/wordpress/client-grant-types.png)

1. Click **Save Changes** if anything was modified.

### Authorize the Application for the Management API

In order for your WordPress site to perform certain actions on behalf of your Auth0 tenant, you'll need to authorize the Application created above to access the Management API. 

1. Navigate to the [APIs](${manage_url}/#/apis) page

1. Click on **Auth0 Management API**, then the **Machine to Machine Applications** tab

1. Look for the Application you created above and click **Unauthorized** to grant access

1. In the panel that appears, select the following scopes below and click **Update** (you can search using the **Filter scopes** field)

    * `create:clients`
    * `update:clients`
    * `update:connections`
    * `create:connections`
    * `read:connections`
    * `create:rules`
    * `delete:rules`
    * `read:users`
    * `update:users`
    * `create:users`
    * `update:guardian_factors`

![Application Advanced Settings](/media/articles/cms/wordpress/grant-client-access-to-api.png)

### Database Connection setup

Database Connections enable the typical username and password login seen on most sites. This type of Connection is 
not required and can be skipped if you're using passwordless or social logins only. 

1. If you used the wizard during setup, navigate to the [Connections > Database](${manage_url}/#/connections/database) page and look for a Connection that has a similar name to the Application setup above. Otherwise, you can create a new  
Connection, use an existing Connection, or use the default **Username-Password-Authentication**. Click an existing Connection name to view settings or click **Create DB Connection** and follow the steps.

    ![Application Advanced Settings](/media/articles/cms/wordpress/database-connection-listing.png)

1. Click the **Settings** tab, set **Password Strength** to the same as your wp-admin setting (default is Fair), and click **Save** at the bottom. If you want your password policy to be stronger or weaker, make sure to set it both here and at **wp-admin > Auth0 > Settings**.

1. Now click the **Applications** tab and activate the Application created above.

    ![Application Advanced Settings](/media/articles/cms/wordpress/db-connection-clients.png)

### Social Connection setup

See our [dedicated page on Social Connections](/identityproviders#social) for detailed information on how to activate and configure these login methods. 

### Update Auth0 settings in WordPress

1. Go to back to the [Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications) page and select the Application created above.

    ![Application Settings](/media/articles/cms/wordpress/auth0-client-settings.png)

1. In a new tab/window, log into wp-admin for your WordPress site and go to **wp-admin > Auth0 > Settings**.

1. Click on the **Basic** tab.

1. Copy **Domain**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** from your Auth0 Application page to your WordPress settings using the Copy to Clipboard buttons next to each field.

1. Make sure **Application Signing Algorithm** matches the Application's Advanced > OAuth setting. 

1. Scroll down and click **Save Changes**.

    ::: note

    :::
