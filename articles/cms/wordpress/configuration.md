description: How to configure WordPress as a client with Auth0.
---

# WordPress Configuration

To configure the *Auth0 for WordPress* plugin, you will need to copy the *Domain*, *Client Id* and *Client Secret* from the *Settings* page of your app in the Auth0 dashboard to the *Basic* settings page of the Auth0 plugin in WordPress.

**Note:** In order to install or customize plugins, you will need to use a self-hosted WordPress.org site. Using the WordPress.com site does not allow installing plugins.

## Create a New Client

You must first create a client in the Auth0 dashboard before you can configure the *Auth0 for WordPress* plugin. If you already have created the client you want to connect to WordPress, you can skip to the next section.

1. Log in to the [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}). (If you don't already have an Auth0 account, you can [create one](https://auth0.com).
2. Navigate to the *Clients* page and click **+ Create Client**.

3. In the *Create Client* window, name your Client and select your Client type, and click **Save**.

## Get your Domain, Client Id and Client Secret

## Auth0 for WordPress Plugin Settings

### Basic

* **Domain:** The app domain copied from the app settings in your dashboard.
* **Client Id:** The app client id copied from the app settings in your dashboard.
* **Client Secret:** The app client secret copied from the app settings in your dashboard.
* **Client token:** The token required to allow the plugin to communicate with Auth0 to update your account settings. If the token has been set, this field will display "Not Visible". If blank, no token has been provided and you will have to [generate a token](/api/v2) with the appropriate scopes listed here.
* **WordPress login enabled:** If enabled, displays a link on the login page to access the regular WordPress login.
* **Allow signup:** User signup will be available only if the WordPress *Anyone can register* option is enabled. You can find this setting under **Settings > General > Membership**.

(See [Multifactor Authentication in Auth0](/multifactor-authentication) for more information.) You can enable other MFA providers on the [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}/#/multifactor).
* **FullContact integration:** Enable this option to fill your user profiles with the data provided by FullContact. A valid API key is required. For more information, see [Augment User Profile with FullContact](/scenarios/mixpanel-fullcontact-salesforce#2-augment-user-profile-with-fullcontact-).

* **Translation:** A valid JSON object representing the Lock's dict parameter. The 'dict' parameter can be a string matching any supported language ('en', 'es', 'it', etc...) or an object containing customized label text. If set, this will override the Title setting.

### Dashboard

Here you can customize the dashboard's display and segmentation of data.

## Integrate the Plugin

The plugin includes an `auth0_user_login` action to provide notification for each time a user logs in or is created in WordPress.

[Learn more about WordPress actions](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API#Actions).

This action accepts five parameters:

1. `$user_id` (int): The id of the user logged in.
2. `$user_profile` (stdClass): The Auth0 profile of the user.
3. `$is_new` (boolean): If the user has created a new WordPress login, this is set to `true`, otherwise `false`. Not to be confused with Auth0 registration, this flag is `true` only if a new user is created in the WordPress database.
4. `$id_token` (string): The user's JWT.
5. `$access_token` (string): The user's access token.

  **Note:** An access token is not provided when using *Implicit Flow*.

To hook to this action, include the following code:

```js
// php
add_action( 'auth0_user_login', 'auth0UserLoginAction', 0,5 );

function auth0UserLoginAction($user_id, $user_profile, $is_new, $id_token, $access_token) {
    ...
}
```
