# User Migration in Login by Auth0

The User Migration functionality uses a core Auth0 feature, [Custom Databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db), combined with URL endpoints in the Login by Auth0 plugin to allow users to authenticate with existing WordPress user accounts.

## How It Works

When you enable data migration, the plugin exposes two secure endpoints that allows Auth0 to authenticate users using WordPress accounts. These endpoints are secured with a secret token and can be set to only allow IP addresses used by Auth0.

The login flow is as follows:

1. A user attempts to login with an Auth0 login form (embedded on your site or hosted at Auth0).
2. If Auth0 can't find a user associated with the provided credentials in your database connection, it proceeds to call the migration endpoint on your WordPress site with the user credentials and the migration token.
3. The plugin finds a user in your WordPress database with the provided username/email and verifies the password.
4. If a user can be successfully authenticated, Auth0 creates the user in the database connection for your site, authenticates the user, and logs them in.
5. The next time the user logs in, they will use the Auth0 user and the migration endpoint will be skipped.

User Migration must be setup when the site is first connected to Auth0. Attempting to turn on or off custom database scripts for a database connection that has already has users will fail. See the **Troubleshooting** section for more information about moving between modes.

## Setup and Configuration

The easiest way to setup User Migration is to use the Setup Wizard when the plugin is first installed. [That process is described here](https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress/installation#option-2-user-migration-setup).

If the User Migration Setup Wizard could not complete or you want to see the process in more detail, follow the steps below. Again, this is starting from scratch with database connection that does not have any users. The following process should be completed on a site with no traffic or with maintenance mode turned on.

1. Make sure you have an Application [created and configured correctly](https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress/configuration#application-setup) and an empty Database Connection [created and activated for the Application](https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress/configuration#database-connection-setup). These can be the same as the ones created in the [Standard Setup Wizard process](https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress/installation#option-1-standard-setup) or created from scratch.
2. In the **Auth0 > Settings** screen in WordPress, make sure the Application's Domain, Client ID and Client Secret are saved in the correct fields in the **Basic** tab.
3. On the **Advanced** tab, turn on the "User Migration Endpoints" setting and click **Save Changes**. If you are using [constant-based settings](https://auth0.com/docs/cms/wordpress/configuration#php-constant-setting-storage), set `AUTH0_ENV_MIGRATION_WS` to `true` and `AUTH0_ENV_MIGRATION_TOKEN` to a secure random string at least 16 digits long and without single quotes or backslashes.
4. Under the settings, you should now see a **Security Token**. Keep this page open as you will need this value later on in the process.
5. In the Auth0 Dashboard, go to the Database Connection you want to use and turn on **Requires Username** and **Import Users to Auth0**.
6. Now click the **Custom Database** tab and turn on **Use my own database**
7. There should be 2 tabs below this setting under the "Database Action Scripts" heading, one for **Login** and one for **Get User**
8. Click on the **Login** tab
9. Clear out all the existing code, open [this link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auth0/wp-auth0/master/lib/scripts-js/db-login.js) in a new tab, copy all the code there, and paste it into the code editor back in Auth0.
10. Look for `{THE_WS_URL}` and replace that with your WordPress instance's site URL, followed by `/index.php?a0_action=migration-ws-login`. The site URL can be found in the **Settings > General** screen in wp-admin. You can test this by pasting the complete URL in your browser. You should see `{"status":401,"error":"Unauthorized"}`
11. Look for `{THE_WS_TOKEN}` and replace that with the token that appears under the "User Migration Endpoints" setting.
12. There should be no errors in the editor. If everything looks good, click **Save** at the top.
13. Click the **Try** button at the top and use a valid WordPress user account in the form that appears. You should see the "The profile is" followed by the user's data. If not, please see the [**Troubleshooting**](#troubleshooting) section below.
14. Now click on the **Get User** tab and complete steps 9 through 13 above with [this code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/auth0/wp-auth0/master/lib/scripts-js/db-get-user.js) and the URL `/index.php?a0_action=migration-ws-get-user`
15. In a new browser session, navigate to a login page on the WordPress site and attempt to login (the user should not already exist in the database). You'll notice that the login process takes a little longer than usual at first but should succeed. Subsequent logins will be faster.
16. (OPTIONAL) To turn on additional security for the migration endpoints, go to **Auth0 > Settings** screen in WordPress, turn on "Migration IPs Whitelist," and then **Save Changes**. Attempt to login with a different user to test that Auth0 can still reach the endpoints.

At this point, the User Migration setup is complete and existing WordPress users will be trickle migrated to the Auth0 Database Connection.

## Troubleshooting

Issues with the User Migration typically come from a few places:

- Incorrect URL or token in the custom database scripts.
- IP whitelist turned on but with incorrect IP addresses.
- Restricted or cached endpoints on your WordPress instance.

The best way to start troubleshooting the issue is to use the **Try** button for the **Login** script found in the Custom Database tab of the Database Connection being used on [Auth0 Dashboard > Connections > Database Connections](${manage_url}/#/connections/database). The following are the error messages you might see and the steps to take to fix.

### "Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0"

This means the custom script is not getting data back in a format it can use. This is likely caused by an incorrect endpoint URL in the database script.

First, copy the URL on line 10 in the script and paste it in your browser. If the endpoint is correct, it should display one of the two messages below:

```
{"status":401,"error":"Unauthorized"}

// or

{"status":403,"error":"Forbidden"}
```

If what you're seeing is the home page or a 404, then the URL is incorrect. Look for your site URL under **Settings > General > Site URL** in the WordPress admin. Add `/index.php?a0_action=migration-ws-login` to the end for the Login script and `/index.php?a0_action=migration-ws-get-user` to the end for the Get User script.

If you're sure the URLs are correct and are still having this issue, check with your host to make sure those URLs are not cached or restricted in any way.

### "Wrong email or password"

This is the default error shown if anything else goes wrong. The easiest way to troubleshoot what's happening is to temporarily output the error that's being sent back (these are opaque by default to avoid displaying anything that might give attackers something to work with).

On line 30 of the Login script, change:

```
callback(null);
```

... to:

```
callback(wpUser.error);
```

... save the script, and try the connection again. Your should see one of the following messages and be able to pin-point the issue with the steps below. Once you've solved the issue, change the script back to what it was.

#### "Forbidden"

This means that the migration endpoints are turned off in your WordPress install. Go to **Auth0 > Settings > Advanced** and turn on the "User Migration Endpoints" setting. Make sure the token that appears there is the same as what is in both custom database scripts.

#### "Unauthorized"

This means that the migration IP whitelist is turned on but the incoming IP address is not on the list. Just below the Login script you should see a list of IP addresses:

![WordPress User Migration - Auth0 IP Addresses](/media/articles/cms/wordpress/auth0-incoming-ip-addresses.png)

Make sure all of those IP addresses appear below the "Migration IPs Whitelist" field under **Auth0 > Settings > Advanced** in the plugin:

![WordPress User Migration - IP Whitelist](/media/articles/cms/wordpress/migration-ip-whitelist-setting-field.png)

If one or more of the IP addresses listed in Auth0 do not appear in WordPress, add the missing ones into the field and save the settings page. Also, please post in the Auth0 [Community](https://community.auth0.com/tags/wordpress) (tagged  `wordpress`) with the missing IP address(es) so we can address the issue.

#### "Unauthorized: missing authorization header"

The security token is either missing in the database script (line 16) or your server is not processing the headers correctly. Check the Login script and make sure that the token exists and matches what is in WordPress. If the token is there and correct, then you'll need to talk to your host to enable the `Authorization` header to be parsed. See [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17018586/apache-2-4-php-fpm-and-authorization-headers) for server troubleshooting and use [the plugin code](https://github.com/auth0/wp-auth0/blob/master/lib/WP_Auth0_Routes.php#L138) as a reference for how the token is retrieved.

#### "Invalid token"

The security token in the database script is incorrect. Check the Login script line 16 and make sure that the token matches what is in WordPress.

#### "Invalid Credentials"

The email address and/or password being used is incorrect. Check to make sure you're entering the correct email address and that the password is correct. You can reset the user password to something else to make sure you have the correct one.
