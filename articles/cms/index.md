# CMS Identity Plugins

Auth0 provides Content Management System Plugins/Extensions to integrate your CMS installation with your Auth0 account. These plugins enable Single Sign On for Enterprises, social login and user/password login through all your instances and platforms.

Login features are implemented through a new Login Widget (powered by Auth0) that enables:

- Single Sign On with Enterprise Directories (LDAP, AD, Google Apps, Office365 and SAML Provider)
- Shared User/Password between multiple WordPress accounts for Single Sign On
- Single Sign On with over 30 [Social Providers](/identityproviders)
- User Management Dashboard
- Optional Two Factor Authentication
- Single Sign On between WordPress and other applications
- Reporting and Analytics
