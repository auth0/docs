# Security Update for Ad/LDAP Connector

**Published**: November 05, 2020

**CVE number**: CVE 2020-15259

### Overview
ad-ldap-connector's admin console does not provide csrf protection, which when exploited may result in remote code execution or confidential data loss.  
CSRF exploits may occur if the user visits a malicious page containing CSRF payload on the same machine that has access to the ad-ldap-connector admin console via a browser. 

### Am I affected?
You may be affected if you use the admin console included with ad-ldap-connector versions <=5.0.12. 

If you do not have ad-ldap-connector admin console enabled or do not visit any other public URL while on the machine it is installed on, you are not affected.

### How to fix that?
Upgrade to the latest version of ad-ldap-connector and restart your admin console. 

### Will this update impact my users?
No
