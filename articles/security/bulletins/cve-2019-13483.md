**Published**: 7/23/2019

**CVE number**: CVE-2019-13483

## Overview

Versions of [Passport-SharePoint](https://github.com/auth0/passport-sharepoint) prior to **0.4.0** do not validate the JWT signature of an Access Token before processing.

This vulnerability allows attackers to forge tokens and bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Am I affected?

You are affected by this vulnerability if you use a [Passport-SharePoint](https://github.com/auth0/passport-sharepoint) version earlier than 0.4.0.

## How do I fix this?

Developers using the [Passport-SharePoint](https://github.com/auth0/passport-sharepoint) library must upgrade to version `0.4.0`.

Please note that Auth0 has deprecated and will no longer maintain this library. Developers should plan to discontinue its use.

### Will this update impact my users?

No. This fix patches the library that your application runs, but it will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions.
