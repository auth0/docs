**CVE number**: CVE 2018-7307

**Credit**: Internal

## Overview

A vulnerability has been identified in the [auth0.js JavaScript library](/libraries/auth0js), affecting versions < `9.3`.

This vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the CSRF check from the [state parameter](/protocols/oauth2/oauth-state) if it's missing from the authorization response, leaving the client vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

Patching this vulnerability requires a library upgrade.

## Am I affected?

If you use a version of auth0.js lower than `9.3` then you are affected by this vulnerability.

## How to fix that?

Developers using the auth0.js library need to upgrade to the version `9.3` or higher.

Updated packages are available on npm. To ensure delivery of additional bug fixes moving forward, please make sure your `package.json` file is updated to take patch and minor level updates of our libraries.

  }
}

### Will this update impact my users?

No. This fix patches the library that your application runs, but will not impact your users, their current state, or any existing sessions.
