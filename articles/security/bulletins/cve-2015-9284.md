# Security Advisory for CSRF vulnerability in OmniAuth

**CVE number**: CVE 2015-9284

## Overview

  A vulnerability has been discovered in [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth) affecting all versions.

  This vulnerability allows attackers to perform [CSRF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery) attacks that uses OmniAuth's default configuration, which may result in account hi-jacking.

  While our OmniAuth SDK [omniauth-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/omniauth-auth0) is not directly affected, this vulnerability cannot be fixed through the SDK we provided, and will need action depending on your Ruby application.

## Am I affected?

  If you use the default configuration of OmniAuth and have setups for multiple providers, you may be affected.

## How to fix that?

OmniAuth has provided a list of mitigations for OmniAuth (v1.9.0 as of July 10, 2019) depending on the Ruby application and can be found here: [Resolving-CVE-2015-9284](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/Resolving-CVE-2015-9284).

As a general guideline, the following should be configured in you OmniAuth setup to prevent CSRF attacks:
* Allow only POST request method
* Enable CSRF protection vis CSRF tokens

### Will this update impact my users?

  No. This change should be transparent to your users if the configurations are made properly.
