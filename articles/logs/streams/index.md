# Log Streams

Log Streams let you export your log events to a target of your choice given URL or via AWS EventBridge. With Log Streams you can:

* export logs to a tool or service you already use
* react to events, such as changed passwords or new registrations, with your own business logic by sending log events to custom webhooks
* send events to AWS EventBridge for processing with lambdas or additional data pipelines

## Log Stream Health

You can troubleshoot potential issues with your stream by looking in the `Health` tab.

1. Log in to the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}).
2. Navigate to **Logs > Streams**.
3. Click on a stream.
4. Select the **Health** tab.

## Log Stream Status

| Status | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Active  | Your stream is enabled with us, and we will attempt to deliver the next log events. |
| Paused  | You have requested that we stop delivery attempts for the stream. You may click the `Resume Stream` option at any time to change the status back to `Active`. |
| Disabled | We have disabled your stream because of successive errors. You may click the `Restart Stream` option at any time to change the status back to `Active` and re-attempt delivery for this stream. |
