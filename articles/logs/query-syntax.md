# Logs Search Query Syntax

When searching for logs, you can create queries using a subset of [Lucene query syntax](http://www.lucenetutorial.com/lucene-query-syntax.html) to refine your search.

The query string is parsed into a series of terms and operators:

* A term can be a single word such as `jane` or `smith`.
* A term can be a phrase surrounded by double quotes (`"customer log"`), which will match all words in the phrase in the same order.
* A term without a field name will only match [these selected fields](/logs/query-syntax#fields-searchable-against-bare-terms) fields.
* Multiple terms can be grouped together with parentheses to form sub-queries.
* All search fields are case sensitive.
* Operators (`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`) work on all searchable fields.

## Searchable fields

The following list of fields are searchable and case sensitive:

* `log_id`: the id of the log event
* `date`: The moment when the event occured.
* `connection`: The connection name related to the event.
* `connection_id`: The connection id related to the event.
* `client_id`: The client id related to the event
* `client_name`: The name of the client related to the event.
* `ip`: The IP address from where the request that caused the log entry originated.
* `user_id`: The user id related to the event.
* `user_name`: The user name related to the event.
* `description`: The description of the event.
* `user_agent`: The user agent that is related to the event.
* `type`: One of the [possible event types](/logs#log-data-event-listing).
* `strategy`: The connection strategy related to the event.
* `strategy_type`: The connection strategy type related to the event.
* `hostname`: the hostname that is being used for the authentication flow.

## Fields searchable against bare terms

If a search term is entered without a field name, it will only be searched against the following fields:

* `user_name`
* `connection`
* `client_name`
* `type`
* `ip`
* `log_id`
* `description`

## Exact matching

To find exact matches, use double quotes: `description:"Username invalid"`.

For example, to find logs with the description `Username invalid`, use `q=description:"Username invalid"`:

## Wildcards

Wildcard searches can be run on terms using the asterisk character (`*`) to replace zero or more characters: `user_name:john*`. They can be used for prefix matching, for example `user_name:j*`. For other uses of wildcards (e.g. suffix matching), literals must have 3 characters or more. For example, `name:*usa` is allowed, but `name:*sa` is not.

The question mark character (`?`), is currently not supported.

For example, to find all logs for users whose usernames start with `john`, use `q=user_name:john*`:

## Dates

A date will always be converted to a zeroed-out state if all values are provided; if `2018-12-18` is provided, it will be converted to `2018-12-18T00:00:00.000Z` internally. Below are some more examples of how various date formats will be converted.

Example | Converted Value
--------|----------------
`2018-12-18` | `2018-12-18T00:00:00.000Z`
`2018-12` | `2018-12-01T00:00:00.000Z`
`2018-12-18T12:22` | `2018-12-18T12:22:00.000Z`
`2018-12-18T15:23:48.123Z` | `2018-12-18T15:23:48.123Z`

## Ranges

You can use ranges in your log search queries. For inclusive ranges use square brackets: `[min TO max]`, and for exclusive ranges use curly brackets: `{min TO max}`.

Curly and square brackets can be combined in the same range expression. You can also use wildcards within ranges.

As an example, to find all logs from December 18, 2018 until the present, use `q=date:[2018-12-18 TO *]`.
If you'd like to search logs from the beginning of your retention period until, but not including, December 19, 2018, use `q=date:[* TO 2018-12-19}`.

## Example queries

Below are some examples to show the kinds of queries you can make with the Management API.

Use Case | Query
---------|------
Search all logs with connections that contains "Pass" | `connection:*pass*`
Search all logs for users with a user name that contains "fred" | `user_name:*fred*`
Search all logs with user id's matching exactly "123" | `user_id:"123"`
Search for all logs with a type starting with "s" | `type:s*`
Search for user names that start with "jane" and end with "smith" | `user_name:jane*smith`
Search for all logs in December 2018 | `date:[2018-12 TO 2018-01-01}`
Search for all logs from December 10, 2018 forward | `date:[2018-12-10 TO *]`
Search for all logs from January 1, 2019 at 1AM, up till, but not including till January 1, 2019 at 12:23:45 | `date:[2019-01-01T01:00:00 TO 2019-01-01T12:23:45}`

## Limitations

When you query for logs with the [list or search logs](/api/v2#!/Logs/get_logs) endpoint, you can retrieve a maximium of 100 logs per request. Additionally, you may only paginate through up to 1,000 search results. If would like to receive more logs, please retrieve your logs [by checkpoint] retrieval.

If you get the error `414 Request-URI Too Large` this means that your query string is larger than the supported length. In this case, refine your search.

## Search engine migration

We are currently migrating our logs search engine to provide customers with the most scalable, robust and fastest search experience. All tenants in the cloud US region were migrated to the latest engine (v3) starting November 15, 2018. Tenants in other cloud regions are still on the previous engine (v2) and will be migrated soon. Tenants whose search queries are incompatible with v3 will be notified.

### Search engine v3 breaking changes

While the query syntax described in this article is compliant with both the old and new engines, there are some special queries that behave different in v2 and v3:

* The `include_totals` field is no longer supported. While in search engine v3 the parameter is accepted and will throw a response with an object format, that object will not contain the `total` field anymore.
* The details field is not searcheable anymore, only the [list of searcheable fields](/logs/query-syntax#searchable-fields) can be used for search and sort.
* Log fields are not tokenized like in v2, so `description:rule` will not match a description with value `Create a rule` nor `Update a rule` like in v2. Instead, use `description:*rule`. See [wildcards](/logs/query-syntax#wildcards) and [exact matching](/logs/query-syntax#exact-matching).
* The .raw field extension is no longer supported and must be removed. In v3, fields match the whole value that is provided and are not tokenized as they were in v2 without the .raw suffix.
* Ranges for dates for which the exact time is not provided, will behave differently than with v2. For example, the following query `q=date:[2018-12-18 TO 2018-12-19]` will return logs from the start of 2018-12-18 *till the end of day of* 2019-12-19 on search engine v2, but it in v3, as all dates that don't include the time will be filled with zeros, it will return logs from the first millisecond of 2018-12-18 (2018-12-18T00:00:00.000Z) *till, and including, the first millisecond* of 2018-12-19T00:00:00.000Z, which means that all logs except for the first millisecond of 2018-12-19 will *not* be included. In order to include the desired date, either the time should be provided or one more day should be added to the range, i.e. `q=date:[2018-12-18 TO 2018-12-20}`. Since our logs only allow searching to nanosecond precision, it is helpful to start with an inclusive datetime `[` and end with
