# Logs

Using the [Dashboard](${manage_url}), you can pull log data on actions performed by administrators using the Dashboard, and authentications made by your users.

## How to View Log Data

The **Logs** page of the [Dashboard](${manage_url}) displays all events that occur, including user authentication and administrative actions such as adding/updating Applications, Connections, and Rules.

Please note that administrative actions will show up in the logs as `API Operation` events.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long is log file data available?

The length of time log data is stored varies depending on your plan.

Plan | Log Retention
-----|--------------
Free | 2 days
Developer | 2 days
Developer Pro | 10 days
Enterprise | 30 days

### How do I view or export log file data?

If you would like to store log data longer than the time period offered by your subscription plan, we recommend you use the [Management API feature that allows you to retrieve the relevant data](api/management/v2#!/Logs/get_logs). Once you've retrieved your data, you can:

* Store the data yourself
* Send the data to an external service such as Splunk (consider using the [Auth0 Logs to Splunk Extension](/extensions/splunk))

#### Retrieving logs from the Management API

You can use the Management API v2 retrieve your logs. There are the two available endpoints, each providing slightly different quantities of information:

* [/api/v2/logs](/api/v2#!/Logs/get_logs): Retrieves log entries that match the provided search criteria. If you do not provide any search criteria, you will get a list of all available entries;
* [/api/v2/logs/{id}](/api/v2#!/Logs/get_logs_by_id): Retrieves the single log entry associated with the provided ID.
