# View Connections

You can configure any number of [connections](/connections) through the Auth0 Dashboard, and then enable them for any application or API. This guide will show you how to view all of the connections that you have configured using Auth0's Dashboard.

1. Navigate to the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/), and click on _Connections_ in the left nav.

2. Select a connection type:

- [Database](${manage_url}/#/connections/database)
- [Social](${manage_url}/#/connections/social)
- [Enterprise](${manage_url}/#/connections/enterprise)
- [Passwordless](${manage_url}/#/connections/passwordless)
