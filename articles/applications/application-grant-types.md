# Application Grant Types

Auth0 provides many different authentication and authorization flows to suit your needs. For example, if you are securing a mobile app, you'd use the [Authorization Code using Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) OAuth 2.0 Grant](/api-auth/grant/authorization-code-pkce), or if you're securing a client-side app (such as a mobile app that's *not* native), you'd use the [Implicit Grant](api-auth/grant/implicit).

However, you might want to limit the use of certain flows (which we'll refer to as "grant types" in this doc) depending on the type of app you're securing. You can set and manage these limitations using the `grant_types` property that each Client has.

In this doc, we'll talk about:

* What grant types are
* The grant types available
* How to set the Client's `grant_type` property
* What grant types are available based on the Client's `grant_type` property value

## What Grant Types Are

OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that allows you to grant limited access to your resources to another entity without exposing credentials. By using Auth0, you can support different OAuth 2.0 flows without worrying about the technical aspects/implementation.

OAuth 2.0 supports several types of grants, which are methods by which you can gain Access Tokens (string values that represent the permissions granted). Different grant types allow different types of access, and based on the needs of your app, some grant types are more appropriate than others. Auth0 allows you to indicate which sets of permissions are appropriate based on the `grant_type` property.

::: note
Not sure which non-legacy grant type is appropriate for your use case? Refer to [Which OAuth 2.0 flow should I use?](/api-auth/which-oauth-flow-to-use) for help.

## Grant Types Available

The following is a list of grant types valid for Auth0 Applications. The grant types can be divided into three different categories:

* Grants that conform with specifications (such as [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html))
* [Auth0 extension grants](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.5)
* Auth0 legacy grants

The following `grant_types`, are either:

* OIDC-conformant (that is, their implementation conforms to the [OIDC specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html))
* Auth0 extension grants

| `grant_type` | More info |
|:-----|:----|
| `implicit` | [Implicit Grant](/api-auth/grant/implicit) |
| `authorization_code` | [Authorization Code Grant](/api-auth/grant/authorization-code) |
| `client_credentials` | [Client Credentials Grant](/api-auth/grant/client-credentials) |
| `password` | [Resource Owner Password Grant](/api-auth/grant/password) |
| `refresh_token` | [Use a Refresh Token](/tokens/refresh-token/current#use-a-refresh-token) |
| `http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-type/password-realm` | [Use an extension grant similar to the Resource Owner Password Grant that includes the ability to indicate a specific realm](/api-auth/grant/password#realm-support) |
| `http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-type/mfa-oob` | [Multifactor Authentication OOB Grant Request](/api-auth/tutorials/multifactor-resource-owner-password#mfa-oob-grant-request) |
| `http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-type/mfa-otp` | [Multifactor Authentication OTP Grant Request](/api-auth/tutorials/multifactor-resource-owner-password#mfa-otp-grant-request) |
| `http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-type/mfa-recovery-code` | [Multifactor Authentication Recovery Grant Request](/api-auth/tutorials/multifactor-resource-owner-password#mfa-recovery-grant-request) |

The following are legacy grant types:

* `http://auth0.com/oauth/legacy/grant-type/ro`
* `http://auth0.com/oauth/legacy/grant-type/ro/jwt-bearer`
* `http://auth0.com/oauth/legacy/grant-type/delegation/refresh_token`
* `http://auth0.com/oauth/legacy/grant-type/delegation/id_token`
* `http://auth0.com/oauth/legacy/grant-type/access_token`

## How to Edit the Client `grant_types` Property

You can set the the `grant_types` property for your Auth0 Client using the Management Dashboard.

::: warning
As of 8 June 2017, new Auth0 customers **cannot** add *any* of the legacy grant types to their Applications. Only customers as of 8 June 2017 can add legacy grant types to their existing Applications.
:::

Begin by navigating to the [Applications page](${manage_url}/#/applications) of the Management Dashboard.

![Auth0 Applications](/media/articles/clients/client-grant-types/clients.png)

Click on the cog icon <i class="icon icon-budicon-329"></i> next to the Client you're interested in to launch its settings page.

![Auth0 Client Settings](/media/articles/clients/client-grant-types/client-settings.png)

Scroll down to the bottom of the settings page, and click **Advanced Settings**.

![Auth0 Client Advanced Settings](/media/articles/clients/client-grant-types/client-advanced-settings.png)

Switch to the **Grant Types** tab and enable or disable the respective grants for this client. Click **Save Changes**.

![Auth0 Client Grant Types](/media/articles/clients/client-grant-types/grant-types.png)

### Use the Management API

In addition to setting the `grant_types` value using the Dasbhoard, you can make a [`PATCH` call to the Update a Client endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Clients/patch_applications_by_id) of the Management API to update the `grant_types` field.

### Errors

Attempting to use any flow with a client lacking the appropriate `grant_types` for that flow (or with the field empty) will result in the following error:

```text
Grant type `grant_type` not allowed for the client.
```

## Information for Existing and New Auth0 Customers

As of 8 June 2017, all Auth0 applications have a `grant_types` property that **must** be populated. Here's how Auth0 will handle this change based on whether you're a current customer with an existing Client or a new customer.

### Existing Applications

To avoid changes in functionality for current Auth0 customers, we will populate the `grant_types` property for all existing Applications as of 8 June 2017 with **all** Auth0 legacy, Auth0 extension, and specification-conformant grant types.

### New Applications

Depending on whether a newly-created Client is [public](/applications/client-types#public-applications) or [confidential](/applications/client-types#confidential-applications), the Client will have varying access to grant types. Trusted first-party applications have access to additional grant types.

#### Public Applications

Public Applications, indicated by the `token_endpoint_auth_method` flag set to `none`, are those created in the Dashboard for Native and Single Page Applications. 

::: panel Token Endpoint Authentication Method
The `Token Endpoint Authentication Method` defines how a client authenticates against the [token endpoint](/api/authentication#authorization-code). Its valid values are:

* `None`, for a public client without a client secret
* `Post`, for a client using HTTP POST parameters
* `Basic`, for a client using HTTP Basic parameters 

You can find this field at the [Client Settings page](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings) of the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}).
:::

By default, Public Applications are created with the following `grant_types`:

* `implicit`
* `authorization_code`
* `refresh_token`

::: note
Public applications **cannot** utilize the `client_credentials` grant type. To add this grant type to a Client using the [Management API](/api/management/v2#!/Clients/patch_clients_by_id), set the **token_endpoint_auth_method** to `client_secret_post` or `client_secret_basic`. Either of these will indicate the Client is confidential, not public.
:::

#### Confidential Applications

Confidential Applications, indicated by the `token_endpoint_auth_method` flag set to anything *except* `none`, are those created in the Dashboard for Regular Web Applications or Non-Interactive Applications. Additionally, any Client where `token_endpoint_auth_method` is unspecified is confidential. By default, Confidential Applications are created with the following `grant_types`:

* `implicit`;
* `authorization_code`;
* `refresh_token`;
* `client_credentials`.

#### Trusted First-Party Applications

Trusted first-party applications can additionally use the following `grant_types`:

* `password`
* `http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-type/password-realm`
* `http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-type/mfa-oob`
* `http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-type/mfa-otp`
* `http://auth0.com/oauth/grant-type/mfa-recovery-code`

::: note
If you are using the [Dashboard](${manage_url}) to enable or disable these grant types, note that all the Password and MFA grant types are enabled when you add the `Password` or `MFA` grant type on your client. You cannot select these individually.
:::

## Secure Alternatives to the Legacy Grant Types

If you're currently using a legacy grant type, refer to the chart below to see which of the secure alternatives you should use instead.

| Legacy Grant Type | Alternative |
|:-----|:----|
|`http://auth0.com/oauth/legacy/grant-type/ro` | Use the [/oauth/token](/api/authentication#authorization-code) endpoint with a grant type of `password`. See [Resource Owner Password Credentials Exchange](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/password) and [Executing the Resource Owner Password Grant](/api-auth/tutorials/password-grant) for additional information. |
| `http://auth0.com/oauth/legacy/grant-type/ro/jwt-bearer` | This feature is disabled by default. If you would like this feature enabled, please [contact support](https://support.auth0.com/) to discuss your use case and prevent the possibility of introducing security vulnerabilities. |
| `http://auth0.com/oauth/legacy/grant-type/delegation/refresh_token` | Use the `oauth/token` endpoint to obtain Refresh Tokens. See [OIDC-conformant Refresh Tokens](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/refresh-tokens) for more info. |
| `http://auth0.com/oauth/legacy/grant-type/delegation/id_token` | This feature is disabled by default. If you would like this feature enabled, please [contact support](https://support.auth0.com/) to discuss your use case and prevent the possibility of introducing security vulnerabilities. |
| `http://auth0.com/oauth/legacy/grant-type/access_token` | Use browser-based social authentication. |

::: note
Those implementing Passwordless Authentication should use [universal login](/hosted-pages/login) instead of the `oauth/ro` endpoint.
:::

## Enable a Legacy Grant Type

::: warning
As of 8 June 2017, new Auth0 customers cannot add any of the legacy grant types to their applications. Legacy grant types are only available for previous customers while they migrate to new flows, to avoid breaking changes. To find the secure alternative for your case refer to [Secure Alternatives to the Legacy Grant Types](#secure-alternatives-to-the-legacy-grant-types).
:::

To enable a legacy grant type, you will need to update the `grant_types` property for you client appropriately. For details on how to do so, refer to [Edit the grant_types Property](#edit-available-grant_types).
