# Machine to Machine Applications

You can use machine-to-machine applications when you want to invoke an API using a non-interactive application, such as a service, command line tool, or IoT device using the [OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant](/api-auth/grant/client-credentials).

## Create a new Machine to Machine Application

To create a new Machine to Machine Application:

1. Log in to the Dashboard and navigate to [Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications).

2. Click **Create Application**. When asked what type of application you'd like to create, select **Machine to Machine Application**. Click **Create** to proceed.

2. Select the API you want to call from the application.

*If you haven't created an API yet, learn [how to configure an API in Auth0](/apis#how-to-configure-an-api-in-auth0).*

::: note
There will already be an **Auth0 Management API** that represents Auth0's APIv2. You can authorize applications to request tokens from this API.

3. Select the scopes you want to grant to the Machine to Machine Application.

A **scope** is a claim that may be issued as part of the Access Token. With this information, the API can enforce fine-grained authorization. You can define scopes in the [API's scopes tab](/scopes/current#define-scopes-using-the-dashboard).

At this point, you're reading to call your API using the Machine to Machine Application.The Quick Start tab will show you how you can call your API using technologies.

To learn how to accept and validate Access Tokens in your API implementation, see the [Backend Quickstarts](/quickstart/backend).

## Settings

The Settings tab lets you edit different application settings:

<%= include('./application-settings/_settings') %>

- **Application Type**: The type of application you are implementing. Select **Machine to Machine Application**.

<%= include('./application-settings/_token-endpoint-auth-method') %>

<%= include('./application-settings/_settings-pt2') %>

### Advanced Settings

<%= include('./application-settings/_adv-settings') %>

<%= include('./application-settings/_trust-token-endpoint-ip-header') %>

## APIs

The **APIs** tab:

* Lists all available APIs for the tenant
* Shows the ones that the Machine to Machine Application is authorized to call
* Lets you authorize additional APIs

For example, you can authorize the same Machine to Machine Application to call both your own API and the Auth0 Management API.
