# Machine to Machine Applications

Machine to Machine applications are used when you want to invoke an API from a non-interactive application like a service, a command line tool, IoT device, etc., using the [OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials Grant](/api-auth/grant/client-credentials).

To create a new Machine to Machine application:

1. Open the Auth0 Management Dashboard and browse to the [Applications section](${manage_url}/#/applications).

2. Click on **Create Application**. You'll be asked what type of application you'd like to create, select **Machine to Machine Application**. Click **Create** to proceed.

2. Select the API you want to call from the Machine to Machine application.

If you haven't created an API yet, learn [how to configure an API in Auth0](/apis#how-to-configure-an-api-in-auth0).

::: note
There will already be an `Auth0 Management API` that represents Auth0's APIv2. You can authorize applications to request tokens from this API as well.

3. Select the scopes you want to grant to the Machine to Machine application.

A scope is a claim that may be issued as part of the Access Token. With this information, the API can enforce fine-grained authorization. If you haven't defined any scope for the API, you can define them in the [API's scopes tab](/scopes/current#define-scopes-using-the-dashboard).

4. Learn how to call your API using the Machine to Machine application.

The Quick Start tab will show you how to call your API using different programming languages. 

To know how to accept and validate Access Tokens in your API implementation, check the [Backend Quickstarts](/quickstart/backend).

## Settings

The Settings tab lets you edit different application settings:

<%= include('./application-settings/_settings') %>

- **Application Type**: The type of application you are implementing. Select **Machine to Machine Application**.

<%= include('./application-settings/_token-endpoint-auth-method') %>

<%= include('./application-settings/_settings-pt2') %>

### Advanced Settings

<%= include('./application-settings/_adv-settings') %>

<%= include('./application-settings/_trust-token-endpoint-ip-header') %>

<%= include('./application-settings/_adv-settings-pt2') %>

## APIs

The APIs tab lists all available APIs for the tenant, shows the ones that the Machine to Machine application is authorized to call, and let you authorize more APIs.

For example, you can authorize the same Machine to Machine application to call both your own API and the Auth0 Management API.
