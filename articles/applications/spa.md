# Single Page Applications

You'll need to define a Single Page Application if you want to integrate Auth0 with front-end apps (built using technologies like Angular, jQuery, or React) that run in a browser.

<%= include('./_configure', { application_type: 'Single Page Web', application_type_create: 'Single Page Web Applications' }) %>

## Settings

<%= include('./application-settings/_settings') %>

- **Application Type**: The type of application you are implementing. For apps with a JavaScript front-ends that utilizes APIs, create an SPA.

<%= include('./application-settings/_settings-pt2') %>

### Advanced Settings

<%= include('./application-settings/_adv-settings') %>
