# Single Page Applications

You need to define a Single Page Application if you want to integrate Auth0 in front-end apps that run on a browser, like Angular, jQuery or React. 

<%= include('./_configure', { application_type: 'Single Page Web', application_type_create: 'Single Page Web Applications' }) %>

<%= include('./application-settings/single-page-app/index') %>
