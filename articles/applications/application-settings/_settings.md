- **Client ID**: The unique identifier for your application. This is the ID you will use with when configuring authentication with Auth0. It is generated by the system when you create a new application and it cannot be modified.

- **Client Secret**: A string used to sign and validate ID Tokens for authentication flows and to gain access to select Auth0 API endpoints. By default, the value is hidden, so check the **Reveal Client Secret** box to see this value.

  While the Client ID is considered public information, the Client Secret **must be kept confidential**. If anyone can access your Client Secret they can issue  tokens and access resources they shouldn't.
