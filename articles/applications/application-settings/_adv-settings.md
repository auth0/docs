#### Application Metadata

Application metadata are custom string keys and values (each of which has a character maximum of 255), set on a per application basis. Metadata is exposed in the Application object as client_metadata, and in Rules as context.clientMetadata

You can create up to 10 sets of metadata.

#### OAuth

Set the OAuth-related settings on this tab:

* By default, all apps/APIs can make a delegation request, but if you want to explicitly grant permissions to selected apps/APIs, you can do so in **Allowed APPs/APIs**.

* Set the algorithm used (**HS256** or **RS256**) for signing your JSON Web Tokens.

* Toggle the switch to indicate if your application is OIDC Conformant or not.
