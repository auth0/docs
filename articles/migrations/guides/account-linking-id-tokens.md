# Migration Guide from Account Linking with ID Tokens

We have identified a weakness in a particular account linking flow that could allow it to be misused in specific circumstances. We have found no evidence that this has been used maliciously but have decided to deprecate the flow to prevent that ever happening.

Therefore, Auth0 requires customers using the affected account linking flow to migrate to a more secure implementation before October 19th, 2018. Migration paths are provided in this guide, which should not result in any lost functionality.

On October 19th, 2018 or anytime after, the affected account linking flow will be disabled and customers using it will experience run-time errors.

## Am I impacted?

You are impacted if you call the [/api/v2/users/{USER_ID}/identities](/api/management/v2#!/Users/post_identities) endpoint using a token (ID or Access Token) with the scope `update:current_user_identities` in the Authorization header and include the secondary account's `user_id` in the payload.

No other use cases are impacted.

## What should I do?

You should review all your calls to the account linking endpoint ([/api/v2/users/{USER_ID}/identities](/api/management/v2#!/Users/post_identities)) and update those that make use of the vulnerable flow described above. You can update your calls to either of the following:

1. **Client-side / user-initiated linking scenarios** -- For client-side linking scenarios, make the call to the [/api/v2/users/{USER_ID}/identities](/api/management/v2#!/Users/post_identities) using an Access Token with the `update:current_user_identities` scope, and provide the ID Token of the secondary account in the payload (`link_with`). This ID Token must be obtained through an OAuth/OIDC-conformant flow. See the [guide on client-side account linking](/link-accounts/user-initiated-linking) for more details.
2. **Server-side linking scenarios** -- For server-side linking scenarios, make the call to the [/api/v2/users/{USER_ID}/identities](/api/management/v2#!/Users/post_identities) endpoint using an Access Token with the `update:users` scope and provide the `user_id` of the secondary account in the payload. See the [guide on server-side account linking](/link-accounts/suggested-linking) for more details.

## More questions

If you have questions, feel free to open a community thread or support ticket.

## Other considerations

This migration is specifically targeted to mitigate a security vulnerability and is a subset of the larger [account linking migration guide](/migrations/guides/account-linking). At this point, you are not required to take further action beyond that described in this guide. However, it is strongly recommended that you fully review the account linking migration guide and, if needed, update your code as soon as possible. Auth0 will notify customers in advance, with a prudent time frame to migrate, before that migration is enforced.
