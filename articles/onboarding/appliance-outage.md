# Critical Support Issue Guidance for Appliance Customers

This document outlines additional support procedure information for enterprise subscription customers with an Auth0 Appliance and shoud be read in conjunction with the general [Enterprise Support Guidance document](/enterprise-support).

Appliance customers must have [Premium Enterprise Support](/enterprise-support#premium-enterprise-support) as a minimum. Refer to your subscription agreement to confirm if other custom support or SLA coverage has been included.

Below are special procedures Appliance customers should follow for Critical Support Issues.  All other information as outlined in the [Enterprise Support Guidance document](/enterprise-support) is still valid and should be followed.

## Special procedures for critical issues impacting production applications for Appliance customers

**To Log a Critical Support Issue**

Appliance customers should email productionoutage@auth0.com to log a critical support issue.

As a secondary point of escalation, Appliance customers can also call our support number on +1 (425) 559-9554 and leave a detailed support message. *Note that this should only be a secondary escalation point, and an email to productionoutage@auth0.com will always yield the fastest and most efficient response.*

Appliance customers may also use the [Auth0 Support Center](https://support.auth0.com) as a primary method of logging a critical support issue, or as a secondary point of escalation.  However, one current limitation of the Auth0 Support Center is customers must have an account with Auth0's cloud service to login to Support Center.  As creating a cloud account is not currently mandatory for Appliance customers, this could be a blocking factor in logging a ticket during a critical outage, and so the recommendation is to use the email option instead.

### Information to provide when logging an issue

To speed resolution, please provide the following when logging an issue via email (in addition to other information listed in the [Enterprise Support Guidance document](/enterprise-support):

* Your Company Name and specific project name (some customers have more than one instance of Auth0)
* Your contact details and the contact details of relevant colleagues such as IT operations staff, including email address and phone numbers with relevant country and area codes.

### What to expect

When an issue has been logged correctly:

* it will be acknowledged immediately by email and assigned a ticket ID number. Additional information may be requested.
* A responding Auth0 support staff member may contact you via email and/or direct you to join a private Slack channel and/or a Zoom web conference to facilitate faster communications.  However, it’s important to remember you should not initiate requests for help via a Slack channel - only via the methods outlined above. Slack channels may not be actively monitored.
* In addition to communications over a web conference or Slack, to preserve a record of an issue, any critical information, such as log files, symptoms, etc should be sent as updates to the ticket via support center.  Any conclusions or next steps should be added to the ticket as well.
* Upon resolution of the issue, an Auth0 support staff member will ask the customer for confirmation the issue has been resolved to their satisfaction and the ticket will be closed only when customer has responded and confirmed issue is resolved.
