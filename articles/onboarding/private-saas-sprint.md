# Private SaaS Deployment Project

### Sprint Customer Onboarding Program

Sprint is Auth0’s onboarding program for enterprise customers.  For customers subscribed to an Auth0 private instance to be deployed on-premises or in the customers cloud provider of choice, the first part of the Sprint program will be the Private SaaS deployment project.  Here's an overview of the main steps:

## Private SaaS Deployment Project Overview

### Step 1 - Project Kickoff

**When?**  This session is generally booked within 5 days of signing your subscription agreement.

**What?** Deploying the Auth0 Private SaaS on your cloud or on-premises infrastructure is a team effort.  This is where we run through how we’re going to get it done!  An Auth0 project manager will work with your designated project manager to build the project plan in this session.

**What?** Your team prepares the relevant infrastructure based on our guidance.

### What's next?

Once the Private SaaS is deployed, an Auth0 Customer Success Manager will work with you to complete the rest of the [Sprint onboarding program](https://auth0.com/docs/onboarding/sprint) - the end result being a joint success plan to drive value throughout the subscription lifecycle.
