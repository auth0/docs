# Auth0 Sprint

Sprint is Auth0’s corporate and enterprise customer onboarding program.  It helps you achieve value quickly by ensuring your setup for success with your Auth0 subscription.

All customer's who subscribe to a qualifying 12 month+ subscription agreement obtained through our enterprise or corporate sales team  will be offered access to Sprint Onboarding.  However, the engagement varies slightly based on your subscription plan and support option.

## Sprint Overview

#### Goal

During the onboarding process, the Auth0 Customer Success Team’s goal is to fulfill our obligation to:

* Have your subscription account correctly provisioned and setup in our systems (including the [appliance deployment project](https://auth0.com/docs/onboarding/appliance-sprint) in the case of on-premise/private-cloud managed service customers)
* Receive information from you that our Customer Success Managers will use to engage with you, measure success and manage your subscription throughout its various lifecycles
* Provide information to you around accessing and utilizing informational, training and support resources to meet your success goals
* Offer high level initial technical architecture guidance and plug you in to our Professional Services offerings if deeper guidance or hands-on development/implementation assistance is desired

The outcome of these obligations is a Success Plan that will be co-managed by your lead contact and the Auth0 Customer Success Management team.

#### Timing

The Sprint program isn’t bound by a specific time restriction, but rather it’s considered completed on delivery of the obligations and the Success Plan.  For customers with a Cloud subscription, this usually takes between 1 and 3 weeks.  For customers with an on-premise or private cloud managed service it can take up to 6 weeks.  Sprint onboarding ends when the final Success Plan is shared with you.

#### What happens after the Sprint program finishes?

At the conclusion of the Sprint program, our Customer Success Management team will continue to monitor your progress against the Success Plan and work with you throughout different stages of the subscription lifecycle or when things are not moving to plan.  This can mean a number of different activities and interactions depending on where you’re at in the development lifecycle and what level of subscription you have.

Aside from engagement with our Customer Success Management team, you’ll have many other resources to move you along the journey as introduced to you in the Sprint program - this includes our support team, customer forums, documentation, videos and webinars.

The table below outlines the different benefits delivered by the Customer Success team based on the [support plan](https://auth0.com/docs/support) included with your subscription.
