# PSaaS Appliance Deployment Project

PSaaS Appliance Sprint is Auth0’s onboarding program for enterprise customers choosing an PSaaS Appliance. It helps you achieve value quickly with your Auth0 enterprise subscription.

Sprint is Auth0’s onboarding program for enterprise customers.  For customers subscribed to an Auth0 private instance to be deployed on-premises or in the customers cloud provider of choice, the first part of the Sprint program will be the PSaaS Appliance deployment project.  Here's an overview of the main steps:

## PSaaS Appliance Deployment Project Overview

The following sections describe what happens during each step of the PSaaS Appliance deployment process.

### Step 1 - Project Kickoff

**When?**  This session is generally booked within 5 days of signing your subscription agreement.

**What?** Deploying the PSaaS Appliance on your cloud or on-premises infrastructure is a team effort.  This is where we run through how we’re going to get it done!  An Auth0 project manager will work with your designated project manager to build the project plan in this session.

## What's next?

Once the PSaaS Appliance is deployed, an Auth0 Customer Success Manager will work with you to complete the rest of the [Sprint onboarding program](https://auth0.com/docs/onboarding/sprint) - the end result being a joint success plan to drive value throughout the subscription lifecycle.
