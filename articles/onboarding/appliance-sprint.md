# Appliance Deployment Project

### Sprint Customer Onboarding Program

Sprint is Auth0’s onboarding program for enterprise customers.  For customers subscribed to an Auth0 private instance to be deployed on-premises or in the customers cloud provider of choice, the first part of the Sprint program will be the appliance deployment project.  Here's an overview of the main steps:

## Appliance Deployment Project Overview

### Step 1 - Project Kickoff

**When?**  This session is generally booked within 5 days of signing your subscription agreement.

**What?** Deploying the Auth0 Appliance on your cloud or on-premises infrastructure is a team effort.  This is where we run through how we’re going to get it done!  An Auth0 project manager will work with your designated project manager to build the project plan in this session.

### Step 2 - Infrastructure Ready

**When?**  Varies by customer and complexity of their deployment.  Ideally 1-3 weeks after signing the subscription agreement.

**What?** Your team prepares the relevant infrastructure based on our guidance.

**What?** Our team configures the appliance on your infrastructure.


### Step 4 - Appliance Handover

**When?** 30-45 days after signing your subscription agreement.

### What's next?

Once the appliance is deployed, an Auth0 Customer Success Manager will work with you to complete the rest of the [Sprint onboarding program](https://auth0.com/docs/onboarding/sprint) - the end result being a joint success plan to drive value throughout the subscription lifecycle.
