# Authorization Policies

Behind the scenes, [role-based authorization](/authorization/concepts/rbac) uses a pre-configured authorization policy, which contains conditions that allow code to evaluate whether a user should be permitted to access a protected API.

The authorization policy determines:

* how to define and organize the users or roles that are affected by the policy
* what logic and conditions apply to the policy and whether their outcome permits or denies access

When using Auth0's core authorization and [role-based access control (RBAC)](/authorization/concepts/rbac), the policy includes evaluating the roles and permissions assigned to users. To use these features, you must [enable role-based access control for APIs](/authorization/guides/dashboard/enable-rbac). 

You can further customize the authorization policy by using [rules](/rules). To learn how, see [Rules for Authorization Policies](/authorization/concepts/authz-rules).
