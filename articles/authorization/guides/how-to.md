# How to Use Auth0's Core Authorization Feature Set

The core Authorization features of Auth0 allow for [role-based access control (RBAC)](/authorization/concepts/rbac) of your APIs. 

<%= include('../_includes/_enable-authz-core') %>

To use the core functionality most efficiently, you should do the following:

1. [Register API with Auth0](/architecture-scenarios/mobile-api/part-2#create-the-api)
2. [Define permissions for API](/authorization/guides/dashboard/add-permissions-apis)
3. [Create roles](/authorization/guides/dashboard/create-roles)
4. [Assign roles to users](/authorization/guides/dashboard/assign-roles-users)
5. [Assign permissions to users](/authorization/guides/dashboard/assign-permissions-users), if needed.
