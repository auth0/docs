# Remove Permissions Assigned to Roles

This guide will show you how to remove the [permissions](/authorization/concepts/rbac) assigned to a role using Auth0's Dashboard. This task can also be performed [using the Management API](/authorization/guides/api/remove-role-permissions). The assigned permissions and roles are used with the API Authorization Core feature set.
