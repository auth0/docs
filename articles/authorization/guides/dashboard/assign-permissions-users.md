# Assign Permissions to Users

This guide will show you how to assign [permissions](/authorization/concepts/rbac) to a user using Auth0's Dashboard. This task can also be performed [using the Management API](/authorization/guides/api/assign-permissions-users). The assigned permissions can be used with the API Authorization Core feature set.

::: note
Adding permissions directly to a user circumvents the benefits of [role-based access control (RBAC)](/authorization/concepts/rbac) and is not typically recommended.
