# Remove Permissions Assigned to Users

This guide will show you how to remove the [permissions](/authorization/concepts/rbac) directly assigned to a user using Auth0's Dashboard. This task can also be performed [using the Management API](/authorization/guides/api/remove-user-permissions). The assigned permissions are used with the API Authorization Core feature set.
