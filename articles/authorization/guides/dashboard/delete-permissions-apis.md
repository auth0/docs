# Delete API Permissions

This guide will show you how to delete permissions from an API using Auth0's Dashboard. This task can also be performed [using the Management API](/authorization/guides/api/update-permissions). 

1. Navigate to the [APIs](${manage_url}/#/apis) page in the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}/), and click the name of the API to view.
