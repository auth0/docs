# Manage Roles

This guide will show you how to manage roles using Auth0's Dashboard. Roles are used with the API Authorization Core feature set.

- [View users assigned to roles](/authorization/guides/dashboard/view-role-users)
- [Remove users assigned to roles](/authorization/guides/dashboard/remove-role-users)
- [Delete roles](/authorization/guides/dashboard/delete-roles)

Using the Management API, you can:
