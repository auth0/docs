# Remove Roles Assigned to a User

This guide will show you how to remove the roles assigned to a user using Auth0's Management API. This task can also be performed using the Dashboard by either [removing users from a role](/authorization/guides/dashboard/remove-role-users) or [removing roles from a user](/authorization/guides/dashboard/remove-user-roles). Roles are used with the API Authorization Core feature set.

<%= include('../../_includes/_enable-authz-core') %>

1. Make a `DELETE` call to the [Delete User Roles endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/user_roles/delete_user_roles). Be sure to replace `USER_ID`, `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `ROLE_ID` placeholder values with your user ID, Access Token, and role ID(s), respectively.

```har
{
	"method": "DELETE",
	"url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/users/USER_ID/roles",
	"headers": [
    { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" },
   	{ "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" },
    { "name": "Cache-Control", "value": "no-cache" }
	],
	"postData": {
    "mimeType": "application/json",
    "text" : "{ \"roles\": [ \"ROLE_ID\", \"ROLE_ID\" ] }"
	}
}
```
