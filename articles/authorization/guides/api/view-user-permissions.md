# View Permissions Assigned to Users

This guide will show you how to view the [permissions](/authorization/concepts/rbac) assigned to a user using Auth0's Management API. This task can also be performed [using the Dashboard](/authorization/guides/dashboard/view-user-permissions). The assigned permissions are used with the API Authorization Core feature set.

<%= include('../../_includes/_enable-authz-core') %>

1. Make a `GET` call to the [Get User Permissions endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/users/get_user_permissions). Be sure to replace `USER_ID` and `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` placeholder values with your user ID and Access Token, respectively.

```har
{
	"method": "GET",
	"url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/users/USER_ID/permissions",
	"headers": [
   	{ "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" }
	]
}
```

| **Value** | **Description** |
| - | - |
| `USER_ID` | Î¤he ID of the user for whom you want to get permissions. |
| `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` | [Access Token for the Management API](/api/management/v2/tokens) with the scope `read:users`. |
