Permissions are selected from pre-defined values. If your list of permissions is blank, you need to make sure you have [defined permissions for your API](/dashboard/guides/apis/add-permissions-apis). You also need to have already [created an API](/getting-started/set-up-api) in your Auth0 Dashboard.
