# Salesforce (Sandbox) Addon

Auth0 supports both the __production__ connection to Salesforce and the __Sandbox__, the only difference being the endpoints hosted by Salesforce: `https://login.salesforce.com` and `https://test.salesforce.com` respectively.

::: note
  Under the hood, Auth0 uses <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=remoteaccess_oauth_jwt_flow.htm&language=en_US">OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Token Flow</a> to obtain an <code>access_token</code>. All details of construction of the right JWT are taken care of by Auth0.
