# Auth0 Application Addons

Addons are plugins associated with an Application in Auth0. Usually, they are 3rd party APIs used by the application that Auth0 generates Access Tokens for (such as Salesforce, Azure Service Bus, Azure Mobile Services, SAP, and so on).

## How to configure an Addon

Go to [Dashboard > Applications > Settings > Addons](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/addons) page and use the toggle to enable the add-on you want to configure.

Each integration is different and requires different parameters and configuration. Once the addon is activated, you will see tailored instructions with details on how to integrate with it in the dashboard.
