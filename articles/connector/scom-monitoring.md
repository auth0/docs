# Monitoring the AD/LDAP Connector with System Center Operations Manager

The Auth0 AD/LDAP connector can run as a Service on Windows based machines.

You can monitor the service status using System Center as you would do with any other service.

* Open the __Add Monitoring Wizard__ and select the __Monitoring Type: Windows Service__:

* Select the Server in which the AD/LDAP Connector is installed and then choose "Auth0 ADLDAP":

* Select the limits of **CPU** and **Memory limits**. Eg: 10% of CPU and 200MB of RAM are good limits to trigger alerts.

We also recommend setting up a _synthetic transaction_ to monitor end-to-end authentication. See [Monitor Auth0 Using SCOM](/monitoring/guides/monitor-using-SCOM) for more information.

## AD/LDAP Connector Health Webtask
[Here](https://github.com/sandrinodimattia/auth0-ldap-connector-health-webtask) is a way to monitor health of AD/LDAP connector from Auth0 perspective.  This can be done in addition to monitoring from an infrastructure perspective.
