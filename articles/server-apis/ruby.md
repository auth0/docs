## Ruby API Tutorial

> Note: If you're creating a Ruby On Rails app, please check [this other tutorial](/new/server-apis/rails).

Otherwise, Please follow the steps below to configure your existing Ruby app to use it with Auth0.

### 1. Add jwt dependency to your Gemfile

You need to add the jwt dependency.

Open your Gemfile and add the following:

@@snippet(meta.snippets.dependancies)@@

### 2. Validate JWT token

You need to validate the [JWT](/jwt)s to make sure the user is authenticated. For that, in a filter or in a middleware processor that runs before your actions, you should write the following code:

@@snippet(meta.snippets.use)@@

### 3. You're done!

Now you have both your FrontEnd and Backend configured to use Auth0. Congrats, you're awesome!
