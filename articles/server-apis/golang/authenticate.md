**Otherwise, Please follow the steps below to configure your existing Go Programming Language app to use it with Auth0.**

<%= include('../../_includes/_signup') %>

### 1. Install `go-jwt-middleware` dependency

Install `go-jwt-middleware` to check for JWTs on HTTP requests.

Just run the following code to install the dependency

${snippet(meta.snippets.dependencies)}

### 2. Configure `go-jwt-middleware` to use your Auth0 Account

You need to set the ClientSecret in `go-jwt-middleware`'s configuration so that it can validate [JWTs](/jwt) for you.

${snippet(meta.snippets.setup)}

### 3. Secure your API

Now, you can use the `go-jwt-middleware` to secure your API. You can do so using `net/http` handlers or using `negroni` middlewares as well.

${snippet(meta.snippets.use)}


### 4. Call Your API

You can now make requests against your secure API by providing the Authorization header in your requests with a valid JWT id_token.

```har
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "http://localhost:3001/path_to_your_api",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer YOUR_ID_TOKEN_HERE" }
  ]
}
```

### 5. You're done!

Now you have both your FrontEnd and Backend configured to use Auth0. Congrats, you're awesome!
