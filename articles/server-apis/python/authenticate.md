title: Authenticate
description: This tutorial will show you how to use the Auth0 Python SDK to add authentication and authorization to your API.
---

You can get started by either downloading the seed project or if you would like to add Auth0 to an existing application you can follow the tutorial steps.

<%= include('../../_includes/_package', {
  pkgRepo: 'auth0-python',
  pkgBranch: 'master',
  pkgPath: 'examples/flask-api',
  pkgFilePath: null,
  pkgType: 'server'
}) %>

::: panel-info System Requirements
This tutorial and seed project have been tested with the following:

* Python 2.7
* Flask 0.10.1
* Flask-Cors 2.1.0
* PyJWT 1.4.0
:::

<%= include('../../_includes/_signup') %>

**If you have an existing application, please follow the steps below.**

### 1. Add the needed dependencies

In this example, we'll be using Flask and we'll be validating the JWT. For that, add the following dependencies to your `requirements.txt`.

${snippet(meta.snippets.dependencies)}

### 2. Create the JWT Validation annotation

Now, you need to validate the [JWT](/jwt). For that, we'll create a custom annotation.

${snippet(meta.snippets.setup)}

### 3. Use this annotation in your methods

Now, you can just use this annotation in your methods

${snippet(meta.snippets.use)}

### 4. Call Your API

You can now make requests against your secure API by providing the Authorization header in your requests with a valid JWT id_token.

```har
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "http://localhost:8000/path_to_your_api",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer YOUR_ID_TOKEN_HERE" }
  ]
}
```

### 5. You're done!

Now you have both your FrontEnd and Backend configured to use Auth0. Congrats, you're awesome!

### Note for Python 2.7

If you're using Python 2.7 and you already have the `jwt` package installed, you need to do the following to get this working:

```bash
pip uninstall jwt
pip uninstall pyjwt
pip install pyjwt
```
