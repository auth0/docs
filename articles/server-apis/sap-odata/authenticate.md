### Additional information

> Under the hood, Auth0 uses [SAML 2.0 Bearer Assertion Flow for OAuth 2.0](http://help.sap.com/saphelp_nw74/helpdata/en/12/41087770d9441682e3e02958997846/content.htm) to obtain an `access_token`. All details of construction of the right SAML token are taken care of by Auth0.
