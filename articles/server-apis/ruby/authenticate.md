description: This tutorial will show you how to use the Auth0 Ruby SDK to add authentication and authorization to your API.
---

You can get started by either downloading the seed project or if you would like to add Auth0 to an existing application you can follow these tutorial steps.

<%= include('../../_includes/_package', {
  org: 'auth0-samples',
  repo: 'auth0-ruby-api-samples',
  path: '',
  requirements: [
    'Ruby 2.1.7'
  ]
}) %>

> Note: If you're creating a Ruby On Rails app, please check [this other tutorial](/server-apis/rails).

Otherwise, Please follow the steps below to configure your existing Ruby app to use it with Auth0.

### 1. Add jwt dependency to your Gemfile

You need to add the jwt dependency.

Open your Gemfile and add the following:

${snippet(meta.snippets.dependencies)}

### 2. Validate JWT token

You need to validate the [JWT](/jwt)s to make sure the user is authenticated. For that, you can use the following code:

${snippet(meta.snippets.use)}

### 3. Call Your API
You can now make requests against your secure API by providing the Authorization header in your requests with a valid JWT id_token.

```har
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "http://localhost:8000/path_to_your_api",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer YOUR_ID_TOKEN_HERE" }
  ]
}
```

### 4. You're done!

Now you have both your frontend and backend configured to use Auth0. Congrats, you're awesome!
