### Additional information

Auth0 supports both the __production__ connection to Salesforce and the __Sandbox__, the only difference being the endpoints hosted by Salesforce: `https://login.salesforce.com` and `https://test.salesforce.com` respectively.

The integration also supports getting tokens for __Salesforce Community Sites__. For this to work, you need to pass two additional parameters:

```
...
community_name: 'mycommunity',
community_url_section: 'members'
...

```

> Under the hood, Auth0 uses [OAuth 2.0 JWT Bearer Token Flow](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=remoteaccess_oauth_jwt_flow.htm&language=en_US) to obtain an `access_token`. All details of construction of the right JWT are taken care of by Auth0.
