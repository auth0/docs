## Nginx API Tutorial

::: panel-info System Requirements
This tutorial and seed project have been tested with the following:
* Openresty 1.9.7.2
:::

**Please follow the steps below to secure your existing API with an Nginx reverse-proxy that's configured to process JWT's generated by your Auth0 account.**

### 1. Install the `nginx-jwt` script into your Nginx server

The [`nginx-jwt`](https://github.com/auth0/nginx-jwt) script is a Lua script that is designed to run on Nginx servers that have the [HttpLuaModule](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#readme) installed. But ultimately its dependencies require components available in the [OpenResty](http://openresty.org/) distribution of Nginx. Therefore, it is recommended that you use **OpenResty** as your Nginx server, and these instructions make that assumption.

1. Download the latest archive package from [releases](https://github.com/auth0/nginx-jwt/releases).
1. Extract the archive and deploy its contents to a directory on your Nginx server.
1. Specify this directory's path using ngx_lua's [lua_package_path](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_path) directive:

### 2. Configure `nginx-jwt` with your Auth0 account

1. Export the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable on the Nginx host, setting it equal to your Auth0 Client Secret (`${account.clientSecret}`).
1. Export the `JWT_SECRET_IS_BASE64_ENCODED` environment variable on the Nginx host, setting it equal to `true`.
1. Expose both environment variables to the Nginx server:

### 3. Secure your API

Now, secure one or more locations that point to your backing service endpoints by using the [access_by_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#access_by_lua) directive to call the `nginx-jwt` script's [`auth()`](https://github.com/auth0/nginx-jwt#auth) function before executing any [proxy_* directives](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html):

### 4. Call Your API

You can now make requests against your secure API by providing the Authorization header in your requests with a valid JWT id_token.

```har
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "http://localhost:8000/path_to_your_api",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer YOUR_ID_TOKEN_HERE" }
  ]
}
```

### 5. You're done!

Now you have both your FrontEnd and Backend configured to use Auth0. Congrats, you're awesome!
