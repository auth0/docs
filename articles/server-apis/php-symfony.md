# Symfony Auth0 JWT Bundle
This bundle helps you integrate your Symfony WebApp with [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to achieve Single Sign On with a few simple steps. You can see an example of usage [here](https://github.com/auth0/jwt-auth-bundle/tree/master/example)

##Tutorial

###1. Install dependencies

We recommend using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/doc/01-basic-usage.md) to install the library.

Modify your `composer.json` to add the following dependencies and run `composer update`.

###2. Add the bundle to your AppKernell.php file

```php

class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(

            ...

            new \Auth0\JWTAuthBundle\Auth0JWTAuthBundle(),

            ...

        );

        ...

        return $bundles;
    }

```

###3. Configure your Auth0 app data

Modify the file /app/config/config.yml

###4. Setup your User and UserProvider

Create your User and UserProvider.

The UserProvider must implements the JWTUserProviderInterface (see /source/AppBundle/Security/A0UserProvider). This class should implement 2 methods:

- loadUserByJWT: This method receives the decoded JWT (but overloaded with the encoded token on the token attribute) and should return a User.

- getAnonymousUser: This method should return an anonymous user that represents an unauthenticated one (usually represented by the role *IS_AUTHENTICATED_ANONYMOUSLY*).
*Both methods can throw an AuthenticationException exception in case that the user is not found, in the case of the loadUserByJWT method, or you don't want to handle unauthenticated users on your app, in the case of the getAnonymousUser method.*

Then configure your UserProvider on /app/config/services.yml

```yml
services:
    a0_user_provider:
        class: AppBundle\Security\A0UserProvider
        arguments: ["@jwt_auth.auth0_service"]
```

###5. Setup the SecurityProvider

Modify the file /app/config/security.yml:

- define your user provider
- define your secured area that want to authenticate using JWT
- define the access_control section with the roles needed for each route
