# Single Sign On (SSO) with Auth0

Single Sign On (SSO) occurs when a user logs in to one application and is then signed in to other applications automatically, regardless of the platform, technology, or domain the user is using.

## Implement SSO

[Universal Login](/hosted-pages/login) is the easiest and most secure way to implement SSO with Auth0.

If you cannot use Universal Login with your application, review the following for additional information on embedded authentication:

* [Lock](/libraries/lock)
* [Auth0.js](/libraries/auth0js)
