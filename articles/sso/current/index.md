# Single Sign On (SSO) with Auth0

Single Sign On (SSO) occurs when a user logs in to one application and is then signed in to other applications automatically, regardless of the platform, technology, or domain the user is using.

::: note
[Universal login](/hosted-pages/login) is the easiest and most secure way to implement SSO with Auth0. If for some reason you cannot use universal login with your application, check out the [Lock](/libraries/lock) page or the [Auth0.js](/libraries/auth0js) page for more information on embedded authentication.
