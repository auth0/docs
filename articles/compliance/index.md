# General Data Protection Regulation

On 27 April 2016, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted legislation known as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which becomes enforceable 25 May 2018. This legislation replaces European Privacy Directive 95/46/EC.

GDPR is intended to unify and strengthen data privacy for individuals located in the European Union (EU). GDPR also extends the applicability of EU data privacy legislation to non-EU companies who store or process data on EU residents and increases the fines that may be levied against companies who are responsible for preventing breaches of personal data or who violate GDPR requirements.

* *Not* be subjected to automatic decision making (a process typically called **profiling**)
