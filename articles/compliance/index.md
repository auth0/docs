# General Data Protection Regulation

On 27 April 2016, the European Parliament and the European Council adopted legislation known as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which becomes enforceable 25 May 2018. This legislation replaces European Privacy Directive 95/46/EC.

GDPR is intended to unify and strengthen data privacy for individuals located in the European Union (EU). GDPR also extends the applicability of EU data privacy legislation to non-EU companies who store or process data on EU residents and increases the fines that may be levied against companies who are responsible for preventing breaches of personal data or who violate GDPR requirements.

## What's New with GDPR

Consent notifications must:

* Be clear and easy to understand
* State the purpose of the data involved and how it will be processed
* Be as easily revoked as it is to grant

### Rights of Individuals

Individuals have the right to:

* See the data the company has about them
* Know how their data will be processed or used
* Be forgotten (the individual may ask the controller of their data to erase the data in question, cease disseminating the data, or halt further data processing)
* Portability (the individual can ask for their data in a standard, machine-readable format and can transit their data to another data controller)
* *Not* be subjected to automatic decision making (a process typically called **profiling**)

### Privacy by Design vs. Privacy by Default

*Forthcoming*

* Fines for non-compliance are much higher and are determined using a tiered system.
* Supervisory authorities have greater investigative powers.
* Organizations processing data must appoint a Data Protection Officer and/or have a Data Privacy Office
