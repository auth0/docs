# Security Advice for Customers

Auth0 recommends the following practices to help ensure the security of your end users data and minimize the probability of a data breach:

* Protect client secrets and keys
* Protect Management Dashboard credentials, and require multifactor authentication for access to the Dashboard
* Review the list of administrators for the Dashboard on a regular basis and remove outdated entries
* Review the list of connections and applications associated with your Auth0 tenants and remove outdated entries
* Ensure that Dashboard administrators use corporate credentials that can be easily revoked if necessary, *not* personal credentials such as a personal email account
* Remove accounts for terminated employees promptly
* Ensure that administrators use devices with mandatory screen locking
* Provide regular training to all Dashboard administrators and developers on security and privacy best practices

::: note
Make sure that you monitor any Auth0 [extensions](/extensions#export-auth0-logs-to-an-external-service) you use to send log data to logging tools with reporting capability.
