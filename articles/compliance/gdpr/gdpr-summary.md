# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) - A Summary

In this article, we summarize the rights and responsibilities of those affected by GDPR, as well as provide a high-level overview of enforcement information.

## Applicability

GDPR applies to a wide scope of territory -- it includes non-EU based services/companies that possess data on EU residents.

## Notifications and Consent

Before you collect personal data from your end users, you must obtain their consent to do so. When requesting consent, your notifications must:

* Be clear and easy to understand
* State the purpose of the data involved and how it will be processed

You must also:

* Explicitly request consent
* Make it as easy for your end-user to revoke their consent as it is to grant consent

## Rights of Individuals

Your end users, as individuals, have the right to:

* See the data the company has about them
* Know how their data will be processed or used
* Be forgotten (the individual may ask the controller of their data to erase the data in question, cease disseminating the data, or halt further data processing)
* Portability (the individual can ask for their data in a standard, machine-readable format and can transit their data to another data controller)
* *Not* be subjected to automatic decision making (a process typically called **profiling**)

## Privacy by Design and Privacy by Default

As the data controller, you must design your app to abide by both privacy by design and privacy by default principles.

**Privacy by design** means that each new implementation that uses personal data must take the protection of such data into consideration.

**Privacy by default** means that the strictest privacy settings automatically apply once the end user acquires a new product or service (that is, without any manual change required on the part of the user).

## Requirements for Data Processors and Controllers

As the data controller, you must:

* Do due diligence to ensure that your data processors provide adequate protection of provided data

Auth0, as the data processor, must:

* Comply with instructions provided by data controllers
* Maintain adequate documentation
* Implement adequate security
* Conduct data protection impact assessments
* Appoint a data protection officer or establish a privacy office
* Comply with rules on international data transfers
* Agree to and sign a written data processing agreement that meets GDPR requirements

## Enforcement

* GDPR mandates that data controllers release notifications regarding data breaches within 72 hours of the incident
* Fines for non-compliance are much higher and are determined using a tiered system
* Supervisory authorities in the European Union have greater investigative powers
* Organizations controlling data must appoint a Data Protection Officer, while organizations processing data should have a Data Privacy Office
