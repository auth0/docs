# Test Partner Connections

1. Click on the __Try__ button on each connection.
1. Login with the identity provider.
1. Wait for the __It Works!__ page that displays the result. 

Auth0 simulates the authentication flow as if it was an application, displaying the __User Profile__ resulting from a successful authentication.

There's a caveat though: for this to work you have to be logged in to the Auth0 Dashboard.

This is often not possible if you are testing a connection that belongs to someone else, and you don't have test credentials with them. This is common when connecting to __Enterprise connections__ such as __<dfn data-key="security-assertion-markup-language">SAML</dfn> IdPs__ or __Active Directory__. 

Your partners can test the new connection.

1. Register a test app.

    - Navigate to [Auth0 Dashboard > Applications > Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications), and click **Create Application**. You can give it any name, for example, `Test App`.

    - In the settings of the newly-created app, configure __Allowed Callback Urls__ to `http://jwt.io`.

    - Select __Save Changes__.

2. Send your partner the link to log in.

    ```text
    https://${account.namespace}/authorize?response_type=token&scope=openid%20profile&client_id=${account.clientId}&redirect_uri=http://jwt.io&connection=THE_CONNECTION_YOU_WANT_TO_TEST
    ```

    Replace these two parameters:

    * __client_id__: the app client_id created in __Step 1__.
    * __connection__: the name of the connection you want to test.

3. Test the connection. When your partner follows the link, they will be redirected to their configured Identity Provider (the __connection__). After successful authentication, they will be sent back to [JWT.io](http://jwt.io) where all user properties will be decoded from the token. 

::: note
The test app is not a _real_ app. [JWT.io](http://jwt.io) is a testing website that decodes tokens sent on a URL fragment.
