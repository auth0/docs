# Create an Auth0 database connection

If you have your own user database, you can use it as an identity provider in Auth0 to authenticate users. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to [create and configure a custom database connection](/connections/database/custom-db/create-db-connection) using the [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}).

## Step 1: Create and configure a custom database connection

The first thing you will do is create a database connection in Auth0:

1. Log in to the Dashboard and navigate to [Connections > Database](${manage_url}/#/connections/database).

2. Click **+ Create DB Connection**.

3. Configure the connection's **settings** as requested.

| **Parameter** | **Definition** |
| - | - |
| **Name** | The name of the connection. The name must start and end with an alphanumeric character, contain only alphanumeric characters and dashes, and not exceed 35 characters. |
| **Requires Username** | Forces users to provide a username *and* email address during registration. |
| **Username length** | Sets the minimum and maximum length for a username. |
| **Disable Sign Ups** | Prevents sign-ups to your application. You will still be able to create users with your API credentials or via the Dashboard, however. |

4. Click **Create** to proceed.

Once Auth0 creates your connection, you'll have the following tabs (in addition to the **Settings** tab):

* Password Policy
* Custom Database
* Applications
* Try Connection

4. Switch over to the **Custom Database** tab.

5. Toggle the **Use my own database** switch to enable this feature.

## Step 2: Create database action scripts

Toggling the **Use my own database** switch enables the **Database Action Scripts** area. This area is where you will create scripts to configure how authentication works when using your database.

You **must** configure a login script; additional scripts for user functionality, such as password resets, are optional.

You can write your database action scripts, or you can begin by selecting a template from the **Templates** dropdown and modifying it as necessary.

The available database actions are as follows.

Name | Description | Parameters
-------|-------------|-----------
Login <br/><span class="label label-danger">Required</span> | Executes each time a user attempts to log in. | `email`, `password`
Create | Executes when a user signs up. | `user.email`, `user.password`
Verify | Executes after a user follows the verification link. | `email`
Change Password | Executes when a user clicks on the confirmation link after a reset password request. | `email`, `newPassword`
Get User | Retrieves a user profile from your database without authenticating the user. | `email`
Delete | Executes when a user is deleted from the API or Auth0 dashboard. | `id`

::: note
When creating users, Auth0 calls the **Get User** script before the **Create** script. Be sure to implement both database action scripts if you are creating new users.

### Create the Login script

The Login script will run each time a user attempts to log in. To create your script, you can:

* Write your Login script 
* Select a template from the **Templates** dropdown.

Users of [IBM's DB2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/db2/) product may find [this sample login script](/connections/database/db2-script) to be of interest.

![Database action script templates](/media/articles/connections/database/mysql/db-connection-login-script.png)

For example, the MySQL Login template is as follows:

```js
function login(email, password, callback) {
  var connection = mysql({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'me',
    password: 'secret',
    database: 'mydb'
  });

  connection.connect();

  var query = "SELECT id, nickname, email, password " +
    "FROM users WHERE email = ?";

  connection.query(query, [email], function (err, results) {
    if (err) return callback(err);
    if (results.length === 0) return callback(new WrongUsernameOrPasswordError(email));
    var user = results[0];

    bcrypt.compare(password, user.password, function (err, isValid) {
      if (err) {
        callback(err);
      } else if (!isValid) {
        callback(new WrongUsernameOrPasswordError(email));
      } else {
        callback(null, {
          id: user.id.toString(),
          nickname: user.nickname,
          email: user.email
        });
      }
    });

  });
}
```

The above script connects to a MySQL database and executes a query to retrieve the first user with `email == user.email`.

With the **bcrypt.compareSync** method, it then validates that the passwords match, and if successful, returns an object containing the user profile information including **id**, **nickname**, and **email**.

This script assumes that you have a **users** table containing these columns. The **id** returned by Login script is used to construct the **user ID** attribute of the user profile. If you are using multiple custom database connections, then **id** value must be unique across all the custom database connections to avoid **user ID** collisions. Our recommendation is to prefix the value of **id** with the connection name (omitting any whitespace).

Be sure to **Save** your changes. Note that clicking **Try** to test your script will also save your script.

### User Metadata and Custom Databases

Depending on your custom database script, you may return a user profile to Auth0 apps. This profile includes the user metadata fields. The **app_metadata** field(s) should be [referred to as **metadata** in scripts for custom databases](/metadata#metadata-and-custom-databases).

## Step 3: Add configuration parameters

You can store parameters, like the credentials required to connect to your database, in the **Settings** section below the script editor. These will be available to all of your scripts, and you can access them using the global configuration object.

You can access parameter values using the `configuration` object in your database action scripts (i.e. `configuration.MYSQL_PASSWORD`).

![Custom database settings](/media/articles/connections/database/mysql/db-connection-configurate.png)

Use the added parameters in your scripts to configure the connection. For example, you might add the following the MySQL Login template:

```js
function login (username, password, callback) {
  var connection = mysql({
    host     : configuration.MYSQL_HOST,
    user     : 'me',
    password : configuration.MYSQL_PASSWORD,
    database : 'mydb'
  });
}
```

## Summary

In this article, we showed you how to configure your database for use with Auth0 as an identity provider. You: 

1. Created an Auth0 database connection
2. Created database action scripts
3. Added configuration parameters

At this point, your database is now ready to act as an Auth0 identity provider.
