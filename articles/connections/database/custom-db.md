# Authenticate Users Using Your Database

If you have your own user database, you can use that database as an identity provider in Auth0 to authenticate users. To set up and use your database for authentication you'll need to:

* Create a [database connection](/connections/database) on the [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}).
* Ensure your database has fields to populate user profiles such as: `id`, `nickname`, `email`, and `password`. See [Auth0 Normalized User Profile](/user-profile/normalized) for details on Auth0's user profile schema and expected fields.
* Provide database action scripts to configure the database as an identity provider.

In this tutorial you'll learn how to connect your user database to Auth0 and configure it as an identity provider.

## Before You Begin

Here are some things to know before you start this process.

* Database action scripts are written in Javascript and run in a [Webtask](https://webtask.io/) environment. In the environment you can use the full JavaScript language and [these Node.js libraries](https://tehsis.github.io/webtaskio-canirequire/).
* Auth0 provides templates for most common databases, such as: **ASP.NET Membership Provider**, **MongoDB**, **MySQL**, **Oracle**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQLServer**, **Windows Azure SQL Database**, and for a web service accessed by **Basic Auth**. Essentially, you can connect to any kind of database or web service with a custom script.
* You can use the [auth0-custom-db-testharness library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/auth0-custom-db-testharness) to deploy, execute, and test the output of database action scripts using a Webtask sandbox environment.
* The [Update Users Using Your Database](/user-profile/customdb) article has information on updating user profile fields.

## Create the database connection

To create the database connection for your database, follow these steps.

1. Navigate to [Connections > Database](${manage_url}/#/connections/database) on the Auth0 dashboard.
2. Click the **+ Create DB Connection** button.
3. Provide a name for the database and configure the available options.

3. Navigate to the **Custom Database** tab.
4. Toggle on the **Use my own database** switch.

![Custom database tab](/media/articles/connections/database/custom-database.png)

## Create database action scripts

Create scripts in the **Database Action Scripts** section to configure how authentication works when using your database.

A Login script is required. Additional scripts for user functionality, such as password resets, are optional. You can write your own scripts or select a template from the **Templates** dropdown and adjust it to your requirements.

The available actions are:

Name | Description | Parameters
-------|-------------|-----------
Login (Required) | Executes each time a user attempts to log in. | `email`, `password`
Create | Executes when a user signs up. | `user.email`, `user.password`
Verify | Executes after a user follows the verification link. | `email`
Change Password | Executes when a user clicks on the confirmation link after a reset password request. | `email`, `newPassword`
Get User | Retrieves a user profile from your database without authenticating the user. | `email`
Delete | Executes when a user is deleted from the API or Auth0 dashboard. | `id`

::: note
When creating users, Auth0 calls the **Get User** script before the **Create** script. Be sure that you have implemented both.
:::

### Create the Login script

The Login script will run each time a user attempts to log in. You can write your own Login script or select a template from the **Templates** dropdown.

::: note
If you are using [IBM's DB2](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/db2/) product, [click here](/connections/database/db2-script) for a sample login script.
:::

![Database action script templates](/media/articles/connections/database/mysql/db-connection-login-script.png)

For example, the MySQL Login template:

```js
function login(email, password, callback) {
  var connection = mysql({
    host: 'localhost',
    user: 'me',
    password: 'secret',
    database: 'mydb'
  });

  connection.connect();

  var query = "SELECT id, nickname, email, password " +
    "FROM users WHERE email = ?";

  connection.query(query, [email], function (err, results) {
    if (err) return callback(err);
    if (results.length === 0) return callback(new WrongUsernameOrPasswordError(email));
    var user = results[0];

    bcrypt.compare(password, user.password, function (err, isValid) {
      if (err) {
        callback(err);
      } else if (!isValid) {
        callback(new WrongUsernameOrPasswordError(email));
      } else {
        callback(null, {
          id: user.id.toString(),
          nickname: user.nickname,
          email: user.email
        });
      }
    });

  });
}

```

The above script connects to a MySQL database and executes a query to retrieve the first user with `email == user.email`. With the `bcrypt.compareSync` method, it then validates that the passwords match, and if successful, returns an object containing the user profile information including `id`, `nickname`, and `email`. This script assumes that you have a `users` table containing these columns. Note that `id` returned by Login script is used to construct `user_id` attribute of user profile. If you are using multiple custom database connections then value of `id` must be unique across all the custom database connections to avoid and `user_id` collisions. Our recommendation is to prefix the value of `id` with connection name without any whitespace in the resulting value.

## Add configuration parameters

You can store parameters, like the credentials required to connect to your database, in the Settings section below the script editor. These will be available to all of your scripts and you can access them using the global configuration object.

You can access parameter values using the `configuration` object in your database action scripts, for example: `configuration.MYSQL_PASSWORD`.

![Custom database settings](/media/articles/connections/database/mysql/db-connection-configurate.png)

Use the added parameters in your scripts to configure the connection. For example, in the MySQL Login template:

```js
function login (username, password, callback) {
  var connection = mysql({
    host     : configuration.MYSQL_HOST,
    user     : 'me',
    password : configuration.MYSQL_PASSWORD,
    database : 'mydb'
  });
}
```

## Error Handling

There are three different errors you can return from a database connection:

* `new WrongUsernameOrPasswordError(<email or user_id>, <message>)`: when you know who the user is and want to keep track of a wrong password.
* `new ValidationError(<error code>, <message>)`: a generic error with an error code.
* `new Error(<message>)`: simple errors (no error code).

To return an error, call the callback with an error as the first parameter:

```js
callback(error);
```

For example:

```js
callback(new ValidationError('email-too-long', 'Email is too long.'));
```

If you use [Lock](/libraries/lock), you can customize the error messages that will be displayed by adding them to the dictionary. For more info, see [Customizing Lock Error Messages](libraries/lock/customizing-error-messages).

## Metadata

Depending on your custom database script, you may return a user profile to Auth0 apps. This profile includes the user metadata fields. The **app_metadata** field(s) should be [referred to as **metadata** in scripts for custom databases](/metadata#metadata-and-custom-databases).

## Troubleshoot

Test the script using the **TRY** button. If your settings are correct you should see the resulting profile:

![Try the login script](/media/articles/connections/database/mysql/db-connection-try-ok.png)

If you do not get the expected result or receive an error, use `console.log`statements in your script and try the connection again. The output of `console.log` prints in the try the script window.

::: note
The [auth0-custom-db-testharness library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/auth0-custom-db-testharness) can be used to deploy, execute, and test the output of database action scripts using a Webtask sandbox environment.

## Auth0 Login widget

If you use [Lock](libraries#lock), enabling the database connection lets users enter their username and password on the Auth0 Login widget. Once entered, this data is passed to your scripts.
