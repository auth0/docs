# Connection Options in the Management API

When creating or updating a connection in the Management API, you may include a variety of custom options in the `options` attribute, such as a password strength for the connection or provider-specific parameters to pass to an Identity Provider.

The following elements are available for the `options` attribute. These are optional when calling the [Create a Connection endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Connections/post_connections) or [Update a Connection endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Connections/patch_connections_by_id).
