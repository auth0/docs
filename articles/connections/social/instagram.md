# Connect your app to Instagram

This article describes how to add login with Instagram to your app. It also discusses how you can get an Access Token in order to access the Instagram API.

First you need to connect your Auth0 application to Instagram. This is summarized in the following steps:

- Register a client at the Instagram Developer Portal
- Get the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
- Copy these keys into your Auth0 settings
- Enable the Instagram social connection in Auth0

## 1. Log into the developer portal

Go to the Instagram [Developer portal](http://instagram.com/developer) and log in with your Instagram credentials.

## 8. Access Instagram API

Once you successfully authenticate a user, Instagram includes an [Access Token](/tokens/access-token) in the user profile it returns to Auth0. 

You can then use this token to call their API.

In order to get a Instagram Access Token, you have to retrieve the full user's profile, using the Auth0 Management API, and extrach the Access Token from the response. For detailed steps refer to [Call an Identity Provider API](/connections/calling-an-external-idp-api).

Once you have the token you can call the API, following Instagram's documentation.

::: note
For more information on these tokens, refer to [Identity Provider Access Tokens](/tokens/idp).
