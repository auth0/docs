# Obtaining an App ID and App Secret for Weibo

To configure a Weibo connection you will need to register Auth0 on the [Weibo App portal](http://open.weibo.com/apps).

This doc refers to the client steps to connect your client. If you are looking to manage authentication in your application, see [Next Steps](#next-steps) below.

## 1. Add a new Application

First log in into your [Weibo portal](http://open.weibo.com/apps), once you have logged in go to the [Development page](http://open.weibo.com/development) and click on the orange button.

This will bring up options for which type of application you wish to create. Select the web application option which should be third from the left.

![Select Web App](/media/articles/connections/social/weibo/select-web-app.png)

In the first field, enter the name for your application. Make sure **Web Application** (the third option 网页应用) is selected for the application type. The check box agrees to the terms.

## 2. Enter your callback URLs

Then you will be brought to your application information page. Click on advanced (高级信息) options from the left sidebar.

Under OAuth2.0 授权设置 enter `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` as the callback urls. Then click on the green button.

## 3. Get your **App Key** and **App Secret**

Return to the basic information page (基本信息) for your application by clicking on the top option under the gear icon for Application Information.

This page will contain your **App Key** and **App Secret**, to be used in the next step.

## 4. Setup the Connection in Auth0

In a seperate tab or page, go to the [Connections > Social](${manage_url}/#/connections/social) section of the Auth0 dashboard.

Click on the **Weibo** connection.

Enter your **App Key** and **App Secret** from Weibo, select your **Attributes** and **Permissions** then click **SAVE**.

Next click on the **Clients** tab next to **Settings** and enable which of your clients will be able to use this connection.

When finished, click **SAVE**.

## 5. Test the Connection

On the [Connections > Social](${manage_url}/#/connections/social) page of the Auth0 dashboard you should now see a **TRY** button with the Weibo connection.

![Try Button](/media/articles/connections/social/weibo/try-connection.png)

Click on this to test the new connection. This should bring up a confirmation page for the connection:

If accepted, you should be able to see the **It Works!** confirmation page that your connection has been configured correctly.
