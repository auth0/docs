# Connect your app to Fitbit

::: panel-warning Fitbit has ended support for OAuth 1.0
New connections with Fitbit will use OAuth 2.0. Please see the following documentation on [Using OAuth 2.0](https://dev.fitbit.com/docs/oauth2/) with Fitbit.
:::

To configure a Fitbit OAuth 2.0 connection, you will need to register a new application in Fitbit.

## 1. Register a New Fitbit App

Log in to the [Fitbit's Developer site](https://dev.fitbit.com), then select **REGISTER AN APP**:
