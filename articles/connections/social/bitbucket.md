# Connect your App to Bitbucket

To connect your Auth0 app to Bitbucket, you will need to generate a *Key* and *Secret* in a Bitbucket app, copy these keys into your Auth0 settings, and enable the connection.

::: note
  This connection will only work with Lock version 9.2 or higher.
:::

1. Login to [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). Click on your account icon in the upper right and select **Bitbucket settings**. Select **OAuth**  in the left nav.

2. To create your app, click **Add consumer**. Provide a name for your app. In the **Callback URL** field, enter the following:

`https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`

<%= include('../_find-auth0-domain-redirects') %>

3. Select the Permissions you want to enable for this connection. At the very least you will need to select the `Account:Email` and `Account:Read` permissions.

4. Click **Save**.

5. To get your *Key* and *Secret*, on the page that follows, click the name of your app under **OAuth consumers** to reveal your keys.

6. Copy your *Client Id* and *Client Secret* into Auth0. In a separate window, log in to your [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}) and select **Connections > Social** in the left nav. Select **Bitbucket**:

7. Copy the `Key` and `Secret` from the **OAuth integrated applications** page on Bitbucket into the fields on this page on Auth0. Select the **Permissions** you want to enable. Click **SAVE**.
