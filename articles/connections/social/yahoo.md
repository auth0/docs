# Obtaining a Client Key and Client Secret for Yahoo!

These steps will guide you through how to create an application with Yahoo! and how to add it as a social connection in the Auth0 Dashboard. 

This doc refers to the client steps to connect your client. If you are looking to manage authentication in your application, see [Next Steps](#next-steps) below.

## 1. Add a New Application

To begin, you need a Yahoo user ID. If you donâ€™t have one ([login.yahoo.com](https://login.yahoo.com) or [admanager.yahoo.com](https://admanager.yahoo.com)), you need to create one.

Then, go to [Yahoo Developer Apps](https://developer.yahoo.com/apps/) and click on the **Create an App** button.

Create an **Application Name** and select **Web Application** as the **Application Type**. 

![Enter your app data](/media/articles/connections/social/yahoo/enter-fields.png)

In the **Callback Domain** field enter:

`https://${account.namespace}`

For the **API Permissions** make sure to select at least one user data API:

## 2. Get your **Client Key** and **Client Secret**

Once the application is created you will see a **Client ID** (Consumer Key) and **Client Secret** (Consumer Secret). Copy these values as you will use them to set up the connection in Auth0.

## 3. Set up the Connection in Auth0

In a seperate tab or page, go to the [Connections > Social](${manage_url}/#/connections/social) section of the Auth0 dashboard.

Click on the **Yahoo!** connection.

Enter your **Client Key** and **Client Secret** from Yahoo! then click **SAVE**.

Next click on the **Clients** tab next to **Settings** and enable which of your clients will be able to use this connection.

![Enable Clients](/media/articles/connections/social/yahoo/enable-clients.png)

When finished, click **SAVE**.

## 4. Test the Connection

On the [Connections > Social](${manage_url}/#/connections/social) page of the Auth0 dashboard you should now see a **TRY** button with the Yahoo! connection.

![Try button](/media/articles/connections/social/yahoo/try-button.png)

Click on this to test the new connection. This should bring up a confirmation page for the connection:

![Connection Approval](/media/articles/connections/social/yahoo/approve-connection.png)

If accepted, you should be able to see the **It Works!** confirmation page that your connection has been configured correctly.
