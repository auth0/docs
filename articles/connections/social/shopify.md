# Connect your app to Shopify

To connect your Auth0 app to Shopify, you will need to create an app on the Shopify Partner portal to generate  *API Key* and *Shared Secret*, copy these credentials into your Auth0 settings, and enable the connection.

::: panel-warning User profile not available
Due to Shopify's OAuth implementation, successful user authentication returns the **Shop** profile, not the user profile.
