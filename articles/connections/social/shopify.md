# Add Shopify Login to Your App

This guide will show you how to add functionality to your web app that allows your users to log in with Shopify. 

## Prerequisites

Before connecting your Auth0 app to Shopify, you must be a [member of the Shopify Partners program](https://www.shopify.com/partners).

## 1. Set up your app in Shopify

To learn how, see Shopify's [Public Apps](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/getting-started/authentication/public-authentication#generate-credentials-from-your-partner-dashboard) docs. During this process, Shopify will generate an **API key** and **API secret key** for your application; make note of these.

While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| App URL | `https://${manage_url}.auth0.com` |
| Whitelisted redirection URL(s) | `https://${manage_url}.auth0.com/login/callback` |

<%= include('../_find-auth0-domain-redirects') %>

## 2. Create and enable a connection in Auth0

[Set up the Shopify social connection](/connections/guides/set-up-connections-social) in Auth0. Make sure you have the **API key** and the **API secret key** generated in Step 1.

## 3. Test the connection

You're ready to [test your connection](/connections/guides/test-connections-social). After logging in, you'll be prompted to allow your app access. To do so, click **Install unlisted app**.

::: note
To automatically authenticate users who have already been verified by Auth0, you can use the [Multipass](https://help.shopify.com/api/reference/multipass) feature.
