* Only the last one-time password (or link) issued will be accepted. Once the latest one is issued, any others are invalidated. Once used, the latest one is also invalidated.
* Only three failed attempts to input the one-time password are allowed. After this, a new code will need to be requested.
* The one-time password issued will be valid (by default) for three minutes before it expires. This time can be altered in the connection settings in the [Dashboard](${manage_url}).
