# Connect your app to ADFS

First, provide this information to your ADFS administrator:

* Realm Identifier: `urn:auth0:${account.tenant}`
* Endpoint: `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` (or, if you are using the [custom domains](/custom-domains) feature, `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`)

::: note
If you want to use the [/oauth/ro](/api/authentication/reference#resource-owner) endpoint you must enable `/adfs/services/trust/13/usernamemixed`.
:::

::: panel Federation Metadata
The Federation Metadata file contains information about the ADFS server's certificates. If the Federation Metadata endpoint (`/FederationMetadata/2007-06/FederationMetadata.xml`) is enabled in ADFS, Auth0 can periodically (once a day) look for changes in the configuration, like a new signing certificate added to prepare for a rollover. Because of this, enabling the Federation Metadata endpoint is preferred to providing a standalone metadata file. If you provide a standalone metadata file, we will notify you via email when the certificates are close to their expiration date.

## Scripted setup

For automated integration, this script uses the [ADFS PowerShell SnapIn](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/adfs2-powershell-basics.aspx) to create and configure a **Relying Party** that will issue, for the authenticated user, the following claims: **email**, **upn**, **given name** and **surname**.

```powershell
(new-object Net.WebClient -property @{Encoding = [Text.Encoding]::UTF8}).DownloadString("https://raw.github.com/auth0/adfs-auth0/master/adfs.ps1") | iex
AddRelyingParty "urn:auth0:${account.tenant}" "https://${account.namespace}/login/callback"
```

If you are using the [custom domains](/custom-domains) feature, you will need to replace the last URL in the above script with `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.

Copy and paste the script above into the Windows PowerShell window.

::: note
You must run this script as an administrator of your system.
:::

### What the script does

#### 1. Creates the Relying Party on ADFS

The script creates the relying party on ADFS, as follows:

```powershell
$realm = "urn:auth0:${account.tenant}";
$webAppEndpoint = "https://${account.namespace}/login/callback";

Add-PSSnapin Microsoft.Adfs.Powershell
Add-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust -Name $realm -Identifier $realm -WSFedEndpoint $webAppEndpoint
$rp = Get-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust -Name $realm
```

If you are using the [custom domains](/custom-domains) feature, you will need to replace the `$webAppEndpoint` value with `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.

#### 2. Creates rules to output common attributes

The script also creates rules to output the most common attribures, such as email, UPN, given name, or surname:

```powershell
$rules = @'
@RuleName = "Store: ActiveDirectory -> Mail (ldap attribute: mail), Name (ldap attribute: displayName), Name ID (ldap attribute: userPrincipalName), GivenName (ldap attribute: givenName), Surname (ldap attribute: sn)"
c:[Type == "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/windowsaccountname", Issuer == "AD AUTHORITY"]
=> issue(store = "Active Directory",
    types = ("http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress",
             "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name",
             "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier",
             "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname",
             "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname"), query = ";mail,displayName,userPrincipalName,givenName,sn;{0}", param = c.Value);
'@

Set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust –TargetName $realm -IssuanceTransformRules $rules

$rSet = New-ADFSClaimRuleSet –ClaimRule '=> issue(Type = "http://schemas.microsoft.com/authorization/claims/permit", Value = "true");'
Set-ADFSRelyingPartyTrust –TargetName $realm –IssuanceAuthorizationRules $rSet.ClaimRulesString
```

## Manual setup

If you don't feel comfortable executing the script, you can follow these manual steps:

1. Open the ADFS Management Console.
1. Click on **Add Relying Party Trust**.
1. Click **Start** on the first step.
1. Select **Enter data about the relying party manually** and click **Next**.
    ![](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/adfs/adfs-importmanual.png)
1. Enter an arbitrary name (such as "${account.appName}") and click **Next**.
1. Leave the default selection (`ADFS 2.0 profile`) and click **Next**.
1. Leave the default (`no encryption certificate`) and click **Next**.
1. Check **Enable support for the WS-Federation...**, enter the following value in the textbox and click **Next**.

    `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`
    ![](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/adfs/adfs-url.png)

    ::: note
    If you are using the [custom domains](/custom-domains) feature, use the following URL format instead: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
    :::

1. Add a *Relying party trust identifier* with the following value and click **Add** and then **Next**.

    `urn:auth0:${account.tenant}`
    ![](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/adfs/adfs-identifier.png)

1. Leave the default option (*Permit all users...*) and click **Next**.
1. Click **Next** and then **Close**. The UI will show a new window to edit the **Claim Rules**.
1. Click on **Add Rule...**.
1. Leave the default option (*Send LDAP Attributes as Claims*).

    ![](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/adfs/adfs-sendldap.png)

1. Give the rule an arbitrary name that describes what it does. For example:

    `Map ActiveDirectory attributes (mail -> Mail, displayName -> Name, userPrincipalName -> NameID, givenName -> GiveName, sn -> Surname)`

1. Select the mappings as shown in this image and click **Finish**.

    ![](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/adfs/adfs-claimrules.png)

1. (Optional) Adding additional LDAP attributes

  The mappings created on step **15** are the most commonly used, but if you need additional LDAP attributes with information about the user, you can add more claim mappings.

::: note
If you already closed the window on the previous step, select **Edit Claim Rules** on the context menu for the Relying Party Trust you created, and edit the rule from step **14**).
:::

Create a row for every additional LDAP attribute you need, choosing the attribute name on the left column and desired claim type on the right column.

If the claim type you are looking for doesn't exist, you have two options:

* Type a namespace-qualified name for the new claim (for example `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/department`).
* Register a new claim type (under **AD FS | Services | Claim Descriptions**) on the ADFS admin console), and use the claim name in the mapping.

Auth0 will use the name part of the claim type (for example `department` in `http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/department`) as the attribute name for the user profile.

## Next Steps

Now that you have a working connection, the next step is to configure your application to use it. You can follow our step-by-step quickstarts or use directly our libraries and API.
