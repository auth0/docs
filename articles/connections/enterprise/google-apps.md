# Connect Your Google App with Auth0

You can connect your Auth0 Application to Google Apps by providing the Google *Client ID* and *Client Secret* to Auth0.

## Generate the Google Client ID and Client Secret

1. While logged in to your Google account, go to the [API Manager](https://console.developers.google.com/projectselector/apis/credentials).

2. Create your new app by navigating to **Credentials** using the left-hand menu:

3. While you are on the **Credentials** page, click on **Create a project**.

4. In the dialog box that appears, provide a Project name, answer Google's email- and privacy-related questions, and click **Create**:

5. Google will take a moment to create your project. When the process completes, Google will prompt you to create the credentials you need.

6. Click on **Create credentials** to display a pop-up menu listing the types of credentials you can create. Select the **OAuth client ID** option.

7. At this point, Google will display a warning banner that says, "To create an OAuth client ID, you must first set a product name on the consent screen." Click **Configure consent screen** to begin this process.

8. Provide a **Product Name** that will be shown to users when they log in through Google.

9. Click **Save**.

::: note
Google may show an "unverified app" screen before displaying the consent screen for your app. To remove the unverified app screen, complete the [OAuth Developer Verification](https://support.google.com/code/contact/oauth_app_verification) process.

10. At this point, you will be prompted to provide additional information about your newly-created app.

    * **Authorized JavaScript origins:** `https://${account.namespace}`
    * **Authorized redirect URI:** `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`

13. Click **Create**. Your `Client Id` and `Client Secret` will be displayed:

3. On the Settings screen, provide the following information:

| Parameter | Description |
| - | - |
| **Google Apps Domain** | the Google Apps domain you're using for authentication |
| **Domain Aliases** (optional) | a comma-separated list of domains registered as aliases for the primary domain |
| **Client ID** | the Client ID for your Google Apps Account |
| **Client Secret** | the Client Secret for your Google Apps Account |
| **Attributes** | the flag that indicates how much information you want stored in the Auth0 User Profile. Select one of the two options: **Basic Profile** (includes the `email` and the `email verified` flag) or **Extended Profile** (includes the name, public profile URL, photo, gender, birthdate, country, language, and timezone) |
| **Extended Attributes: Groups** | the distribution list(s) to which the user belongs |
| **Extended Attributes: Is Domain Administrator** | whether the user is a domain administrator or not |
| **Extended Attributes: Is Account Suspended**  | whether the user's account is suspended or not |
| **Extended Attributes: Agreed to Terms** | whether the user's agreed to the terms of service or not |
| Enable Users API | the flag that indicates whether you've chosen to enable the ability to make calls to the Google Directory API |

Click **Save** when you're done.

4. You will need to configure your settings so that your app can use Google's Admin APIs. If you're the administrator, you can click **Continue** on the Connection's *Settings* page to do so. If not, provide the URL you're given to your administrator so that they can adjust the required Settings.

1. Go to the [Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications) page of the Management Dashboard.
2. Select the Application for which you want to enable the Connection.
3. Click the **Connections** icon for your Application.
4. Scroll down to the *Enterprise* section of the Connections page, and find your Google Apps Connection. Click the slider to enable the Connection. If successful, the slide turns green.
