In this type of connection Auth0 will simply check that the request is coming from an IP address that is within the range specified in the configuration. An optional `username` can be assigned to a given range.

Notice that ranges are specified in the [CIDR-notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing). Multiple ranges can be added by separating them with a comma.
