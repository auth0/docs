# Obtain a *ClientId* and *Client Secret* for a Microsoft Azure Active Directory

To allow users to login using a Microsoft Azure Active Directory account, you must register your application through the Microsoft Azure portal. If you don't have a Microsoft Azure account, you can [signup](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial) for free.

**NOTE:** There is no way to create an application that integrates with Microsoft Azure AD without having **your own** Microsoft Azure AD instance.

## 1. Create a new Microsoft Azure Active Directory instance

Login to Microsoft Azure and click on **Active Directory** on the Dashboard.

Click on **ADD+** at the bottom of the screen.

Enter a *subdomain*, e.g.: **${account.tenant}**. This can be any text. (It does not have to match the Auth0 subdomain and it will be used in the next step.) Also enter your country and a friendly name for your organization.

## 2. Create a new application

Once the Microsoft Azure AD instance has been created, you need to create an application. Go to **APPLICATIONS** and click on **ADD AN APPLICATION**.

Select **Add an application my organization is developing**.

Enter a friendly name for the application and select **WEB APPLICATION AND/OR WEB API**.

Proceed to the next screen and enter the following:

* **SIGN-ON URL**: your application URL (completely arbitrary)
* **APP ID URI**: https://**${account.tenant}**.onmicrosoft.com/yourapp

**NOTE:** The **APP ID URI** is just a logical identifier, not a real URL. It is important to use the value as specified above in the **APP ID URI** field. For example, if the Microsoft Azure AD you've just created is **myorg.onmicrosoft.com**, you would enter https://**myorg.onmicrosoft.com***/yourapp* here.

## 3. Configure the application

Once the application has been created, you have to configure it. Click **CONFIGURE** to continue. On this screen you can customize the logo and the application URL that you entered before, if needed.

Enter the following values on **KEYS** and **REPLY URL**, and click **Save**.

* **KEYS**: Select 1 or 2 years (the key will be displayed when these settings are saved)
* **REPLY URL**: https://${account.namespace}/login/callback

The next step is to modify permissions so your app can read the directory. Select the *Read Directory Data* and *Enable sign-on and read users' profiles* delegated permissions.

**NOTE:** If you want to enable extended attributes (like *Extended Profile* or *Security Groups*) you will also need to enable the following permissions: **Application Permissions:** *Read directory data*, **Delegated Permissions:** *Access your organization's directory*.

Click **SAVE** at the bottom of the screen and the key will be displayed. Make sure to copy the value of this key before leaving this screen.

## 4. Copy the Client ID and Secret to Auth0

Login to your [Auth0 Dashboard](${uiURL}), and select the **Connections > Enterprise** menu option. Select **Windows Azure AD**.

Copy the Client ID and the Key generated by Microsoft Azure in the [previous step](#configure-the-application) into the *Client ID* and *Client Secret* fields in Auth0.

**Congratulations!** You are now ready to accept Microsoft Azure AD users.

## Troubleshoot

* When granting access, make sure to use an *Incognito/InPrivate* window  and a Global Administrator user.

* If you get *Access cannot be granted to this service because the service listing is not properly configured by the publisher*, try selecting the **Application is Multi Tenant** option in the Windows Azure AD application on the Azure dashboard.

## Signing Key Rollover in Azure Active Directory

Signing keys are used by the identity provider to sign the authentication token it issues, and by the consumer application (Auth0 in this case) to validate the authenticity of the generated token.

For security purposes, Azure AD’s signing key [rolls on a periodic basis](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-signing-key-rollover/). If this happens, **you do not need to take any action**. Auth0 will use the new key automatically.
