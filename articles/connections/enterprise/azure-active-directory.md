# Obtain a *ClientId* and *Client Secret* for Microsoft Azure Active Directory

::: panel-info Notice
This page uses the current portal of the Azure Active Directory, for information on using the classic portal, [click here.](/connections/enterprise/azure-active-directory-classic)
:::

To allow users to login using a Microsoft Azure Active Directory account, you must register your application through the Microsoft Azure portal. If you don't have a Microsoft Azure account, you can [signup](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free) for free. You can access the Azure management portal from your Microsoft service, or visit [https://manage.windowsazure.com](https://manage.windowsazure.com) and sign in to Azure using the global administrator account that was used to create the Office 365 organization.

**NOTE:** There is no way to create an application that integrates with Microsoft Azure AD without having **your own** Microsoft Azure AD instance.

## 1. Create a new application

Login to Microsoft Azure and choose **Azure Active Directory** from the sidebar.

![Select Active Directory](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/azure-active-directory/azure-ad-1-1.png)

Then under **MANAGE**, select **App registrations**.

![Select App registrations](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/azure-active-directory/azure-ad-1-2.png)

Then click on the **+ ADD** button to add a new application.

Enter a name for the application, select **Web app/API** as the **Application Type**, and for **Sign-on URL** enter your application URL (completely arbitrary).

## 2. Configuring the permissions

Once the application has been created, you will have to configure the permissions. Click on the name of the application to open the **Settings** section, then click **Required permissions**.

![Choose Required Permissions](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/azure-active-directory/azure-ad-3-1.png)

Then click on **Windows Azure Active Directory** to change the access levels.

![Required Permissions](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/azure-active-directory/azure-ad-3-2.png)

The next step is to modify permissions so your app can read the directory. Under **DELEGATED PERMISSIONS** check next to **Sign in and read user profile** and **Read directory data**.

![Check access levels](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/azure-active-directory/azure-ad-3-3.png)

**NOTE:** If you want to enable extended attributes (like *Extended Profile* or *Security Groups*) you will also need to enable the following permissions: **Application Permissions:** *Read directory data*, **Delegated Permissions:** *Access the directory as the signed-in user*.

Click the **SAVE** button at the top to save these changes.

### 3. Creating the key

Next you will need to create a key which will be used as the **Client Secret** in the Auth0 connection. Click on **Keys** from the **Settings** menu.

![Select Keys](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/azure-active-directory/azure-ad-4-1.png)

Enter a name for the key and for the duration of the key select 1 or 2 years.

![Creating a Key](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/azure-active-directory/azure-ad-4-2.png)

Click on **Save** and the key will be displayed. Make sure to copy the value of this key before leaving this screen, this is your **Client Secret** used in the next step.

## 4. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret to Auth0

Login to your [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}), and select the **Connections > Enterprise** menu option. Select **Windows Azure AD**.

For the **Client ID**, this value is stored as the **Application ID** in Azure AD. 

![Application ID](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/azure-active-directory/azure-ad-5-1.png)

For the **Client Secret** use the value that was shown for the key when you created it in the previous step.

![Create Azure AD Connection](/media/articles/connections/enterprise/azure-active-directory/add-azure-connection.png)

Click **SAVE** when you have finished.

**Congratulations!** You are now ready to accept Microsoft Azure AD users.

## Troubleshooting

* Make sure you are in the desired directory to add you application. If you do not have an existing directory you will need to create one.

* When granting access, make sure to use an *Incognito/InPrivate* window  and a Global Administrator user.

* If you get *Access cannot be granted to this service because the service listing is not properly configured by the publisher*, try enabling **Multi Tenanted** in the Windows Azure AD application under **Settings** -> **Properties**.

## Signing Key Rollover in Azure Active Directory

Signing keys are used by the identity provider to sign the authentication token it issues, and by the consumer application (Auth0 in this case) to validate the authenticity of the generated token.

For security purposes, Azure ADâ€™s signing key [rolls on a periodic basis](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-signing-key-rollover/). If this happens, **you do not need to take any action**. Auth0 will use the new key automatically.
