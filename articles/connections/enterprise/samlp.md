# Create a SAMLP Identity Provider Connection

Auth0 allows you to create SAMLP Identity Provider connections using either the Management [Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/connections/enterprise) or [API](/api/management/v2#!/Connections/post_connections).

## Prerequisites

When you're setting up a SAMLP Connection, Auth0 acts as the service provider. As such, you will need to retrieve and provide to Auth0 an X509 signing certificate from the SAML IDP in PEM or CER format.
