# Database Connections

Database Connections allow you to create your own user store against which you can authenticate users instead of using external identity providers like Google or Facebook. With database connections, users authenticate with an email address (or username) and a password. Credentials can be securely stored either in the Auth0 user store or in your own database.

Database connections allow you to create custom fields and store user metadata, import users from a legacy user store, configure password policies, or enable or disable sign-ups. For more details, see [Using Database Connections](/connections/database).
