* Make sure you select __OAuth 2.0 / OpenId Connect__ as the protocols option.
* Your callback URL is:

	https://@@account.namespace@@/login/callback

> Note that you can control the scope of access through Auth0 (currently: profile, email, address, phone). But you will also need to enable that access in the portal checking the right attributes.

##3. Get your App Id and App Secret

Once the application is registered, enter your new `App Id` and `App Secret` into the connection settings in Auth0.
