<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

::: warning
Touch ID with Auth0 has been deprecated. This document is offered as reference for older implementations.
:::

::: note
For an alternative approach, using the [Credentials Manager](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift/blob/master/Auth0/CredentialsManager.swift) utility in Auth0.swift, refer to [Touch ID Authentication](/libraries/auth0-swift/touchid-authentication).
