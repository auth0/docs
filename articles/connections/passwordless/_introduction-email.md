With the e-mail connection, the user is requested to enter their e-mail address. Auth0 then sends an email to that address containing a one-time code.

Once the user enters this code into your application, a new user will be created in the `email` connection. The user is then authenticated by Auth0.

If the e-mail address matches an existing user, Auth0 just authenticates the user:

On mobile platforms, your application will receive an ID Token, the user profile and, optionally, a Refresh Token.
