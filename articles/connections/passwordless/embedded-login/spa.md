# Embedded Passwordless Authentication for SPAs

<%= include('../../../_includes/_embedded_login_warning') %>

## Using Auth0's SDKs to implement Embedded Login

You can implement Passwordless Login using Auth0's Lock widget or if you need complete control of the user experience, you can implement it using Auth0.js:

- [Implementing passwordless with Lock.js](/libraries/lock/v11#passwordless)
- [Implementing passwordless with Auth0.js](/libraries/auth0js#passwordless-login)
