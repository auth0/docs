# Passwordless Authentication with Universal Login

[Universal Login](/universal-login) is Auth0's implementation of the login flow. Each time a user needs to prove their identity, your applications redirect to Universal Login and Auth0 will do what is needed to guarantee the user's identity. It's the preferred way to implement Passwordless Authentication.

To implement Passwordless Authentication in Universal Login you need to customize the login page's HTML. To learn how to do it, please refer to [Configure Universal Login with Passwordless](/dashboard/guides/universal-login/configure-login-page-passwordless).

To integrate Universal Login in your application, please refer to our [Quickstarts](/quickstarts), where you'll find complete examples for all application types and popular platforms.
