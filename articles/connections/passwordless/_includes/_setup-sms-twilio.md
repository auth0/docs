### Open an account with Twilio

You will need a [Twilio Account SID](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/what-is-an-application-sid) and a [Twilio Auth Token](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/what-is-the-auth-token-and-how-can-i-change-it). These are the Twilio API credentials that Auth0 will use to send an SMS to the user.

### Configure the connection

1. Navigate to the [Connections > Passwordless](${manage_url}/#/connections/passwordless) page in the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}/), and enable the SMS toggle.

2. Enter your **Twilio Account SID** and **Twilio Auth Token**.

::: note
To learn how to find your Twilio SID and Auth Token, see Twilio docs: [How to create an Application SID](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/what-is-an-application-sid) and [Auth Tokens and how to change them](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/what-is-the-auth-token-and-how-can-i-change-it).

3. Select your **SMS Source** and depending on your selection, enter either your **Twilio Messaging Service SID** or a **From** phone number. Users will see what you enter as the sender of the SMS.

::: note
To learn about using Twilio Copilot, see Twilio docs: [Sending Messages with Copilot](https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/rest/sending-messages-copilot).
:::

4. In **Message**, enter the body text of the SMS.

::: note
The `@@password@@` placeholder will automatically be replaced with the one-time password that is sent to the user.
:::

5. Adjust settings for your **OTP Expiry** and **OTP Length**, and click **SAVE**.

::: warning
If you choose to extend the amount of time it takes for your one-time password to expire, you should also extend the length of the one-time password code. Otherwise, an attacker has a larger window of time to attempt to guess a short code.

#### Multi-language support

The **Message** area supports multiple languages. 

To choose the language, call the [/passwordless/start authentication endpoint](/api/authentication/reference#get-code-or-link) and set the value of the 'x-request-language' header. When this header is not set, the language is extracted from the 'accept-language' header, which is automatically set by the browser.

#### Message syntax

The **Message** area accepts Liquid syntax. You can use this syntax, combined with exposed parameter values, to programmatically construct elements of the message. For example, you can reference the `request_language` parameter to change the language of the message:

```text
{% if request_language contains 'dutch' %}
   Hier is uw verificatie code: {{ password }}
{% endif %}

{% if request_language contains 'fr-FR' %}
   Ceci est votre code: {{ password }}
{% endif %}
```

The following parameters are available when defining the message template:

| Exposed Parameter | Description |
|:------------------|:---------|
| `password` or `code` | The password to use |
| `phone_number` | The user's phone number |
| `application.name` | The name of the application with which the user is signing up |
| `request_language` | The requested language for message content |

### Enable your apps

Click the **Apps** tab, and enable the apps for which you would like to use Passwordless SMS.
