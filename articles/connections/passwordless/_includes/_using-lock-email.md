When this code runs, it will ask the user for their email address:

![](/media/articles/connections/passwordless/passwordless-email-request-${platform}.png)

Then Auth0 will send to the user an email containing the one-time code:

![](/media/articles/connections/passwordless/passwordless-email-receive-code-${platform}.png)

Lastly, the user enters the one-time password into Lock. Then, if the password is correct, the user is authenticated.
