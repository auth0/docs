With an email connection, the user is asked to enter their email address, to which Auth0 usually sends a one-time-use code. Instead, you can configure Auth0 to send a magic link. If you are using Universal Login, make sure you [configure Universal Login with Passwordless](/dashboard/guides/universal-login/configure-login-page-passwordless).

The user then clicks the button or link in the email and is automatically signed in to your application.
