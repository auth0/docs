::: note 
With magic link transactions, both the initial request and the response to the request must take place in the same browser or the transaction will fail. This is particularly relevant for iOS users, who cannot change their default web browser. 

For example, the user makes the request using Chrome, but iOS opens the magic link received via email using Safari. If this happens, the transaction fails.
