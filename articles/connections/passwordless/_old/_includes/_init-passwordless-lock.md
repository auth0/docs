<dfn data-key="lock">Lock</dfn> with <dfn data-key="passwordless">Passwordless</dfn> Mode is a professional-looking dialog that allows users to log in after receiving a one-time password via email or text message.

After installing [Lock](/libraries/lock) (version 11.2.0 or later), you must initialize it with your `Client Id` and `domain`. You can find this information in the Dashboard on your [application settings](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings) page.
