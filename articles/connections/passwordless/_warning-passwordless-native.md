::: warning
Native passwordless authentication has legacy dependencies and is disabled by default for new tenants. Updates to the native platform SDKs are in progress to allow for embedded passwordless authentication within native apps, but until then, passwordless authentication can still be performed via [universal login](/hosted-pages/login/lock-passwordless).
