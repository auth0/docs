# Using Passwordless on iOS with TouchID

<!-- markdownlint-disable -->

::: warning
This feature is disabled for new tenants as of June 8th 2017. Any tenant created after that date won't have the necessary legacy [grant types](/applications/application-grant-types) to use Touch ID. This document is offered as reference for older implementations.
:::

::: note
For an alternative approach, using the [Credentials Manager](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift/blob/master/Auth0/CredentialsManager.swift) utility in Auth0.swift, refer to [Touch ID Authentication](/libraries/lock-ios/v2/touchid-authentication).
