title: Using Passwordless Authentication with a one-time code via email on SPA
---

<div class="alert alert-info">
This document covers Passwordless Authentication, and uses an older version of auth0.js. If at all possible, we recommend using the newest version of auth0.js instead. You can see a copy of this Passwordless documentation that uses the latest version of auth0.js using the dropdown at the top of this document. If you are interested in upgrading the version of Auth0.js used in your app, take a look at the most recent <a href="/libraries/auth0js/v8/migration-guide">migration guide</a>.

# Authenticate users with a one-time code via e-mail on SPA

<%= include('../../_introduction-email', { isMobile: false }) %>

## Setup

<%= include('../../_setup-email') %>

<%= include('../../_setup-cors') %>

## Implementation

### Use Auth0 UI widget (Lock)

<%= include('../../_init-passwordless-lock') %>

Then you can trigger the login with the following code:

```html
<script src="${lock_passwordless_url}"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  function login(){
    // Initialize Passwordless Lock instance
    var lock = new Auth0LockPasswordless('${account.clientId}', '${account.namespace}');
    // Open the lock in Email Code mode with the ability to handle
    // the authentication in page
    lock.emailcode( function (err, profile, id_token, state) {
      if (!err) {
        // Save the JWT token.
        localStorage.setItem('userToken', id_token);
        //use profile
      }
    });
  }
</script>
<a href="javascript:login()">Login</a>
```

First, this will open a dialog that asks the user for their email address:

![](/media/articles/connections/passwordless/passwordless-email-request-web.png)

Then Auth0 will send an email to the user containing the one-time code:

![](/media/articles/connections/passwordless/passwordless-email-receive-code-web.png)

Lock will ask for the code that has been emailed to the provided address. The code can then be used as a one-time password to log in.

![](/media/articles/connections/passwordless/passwordless-email-enter-code-web.png)

Once the user enters the code received by email, Lock will authenticate them and call the callback function where the `id_token` and profile will be available.

### Use your own UI

<%= include('../../../../_includes/_package', {
  org: 'auth0-samples',
  repo: 'auth0-jquery-passwordless-sample',
  path: ''
}) %>

You can perform passwordless authentication in your SPA with your own custom UI using the [Auth0 JavaScript client library](/libraries/auth0js).

<%= include('../../_init-auth0js', {withCallbackURL:false} ) %>

You must provide a way for the user to enter the email to which the one-time code will be sent. Then you can begin the passwordless authentication with the following code:

```js
function sendEmail(){
  var email = $('input.email').val();
  auth0.requestEmailCode({ email: email }, function(err) {
    if (err) {
      alert('error sending e-mail: ' + err.error_description);
      return;
    }
    // the request was successful and you should
    // receive the code to the specified email
    $('.enter-email').hide();
    $('.enter-code').show();
  });
}
```

This will send an email containing the one-time code. The user must now enter the code into your custom UI. Then you can continue with the login as follows:

```js
function login(){
  var email = $('input.email').val();
  var code = $('input.code').val();

  //submit the passcode to complete authentication
  auth0.verifyEmailCode({ email: email, code: code }, function(err, profile, id_token, access_token) {
      if (err) {
        alert('Couldn\'t login ' + err.message);
      } else {

        //save id_token to local storage
        localStorage.setItem('userToken', id_token);

        //use profile
        alert('Welcome '+ profile.name);
      }
    });
}
```
