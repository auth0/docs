# Passwordless Authentication with a one-time code via e-mail on Regular Web Apps

<%= include('_introduction-email', { isMobile: false }) %>

## Setup

<%= include('_setup-email') %>

<%= include('_setup-callback', {spa:false} )%>

## Implementation

### Use Lock (the Auth0 UI widget)

<%= include('_init-passwordless-lock') %>

Then you can trigger the login using the `callbackURL` option to specify the endpoint that will handle the server-side authentication:

```html
<script src="${lock_url}"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
  function login() {
    var lock = new Auth0LockPasswordless('${account.clientId}', '${account.namespace}', {
      allowedConnections: ['email'],           // Should match the Email connection name, it defaults to 'email'     
      passwordlessMethod: 'code',              // If not specified, defaults to 'code'
      auth: {
        redirectUrl: '${account.callback}',
        responseType: 'code'
      }
    });

    lock.show();
  }
</script>

<a href="javascript:login()">Login</a>
```

This will open a dialog that asks the user for their email address:

![](/media/articles/connections/passwordless/passwordless-email-request-web.png)

Then Auth0 will send an email to the user containing the one-time code:

![](/media/articles/connections/passwordless/passwordless-email-receive-code-web.png)

Lock will ask for the code that has been emailed to the provided address. The code can then be used as a one-time password to log in:

![](/media/articles/connections/passwordless/passwordless-email-enter-code-web.png)

Once the user enters the code received by email, Lock will authenticate the user and redirect to the specified `callbackURL`.

::: note
You can follow any of the [Regular Web App Quickstarts](/quickstart/webapp) to see how to handle the server-side authentication callback. A sample application is available in the [Node.js Passwordless Authentication repository](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-node-passwordless-sample) on GitHub.
:::

### Use your own UI

<%= include('../../_includes/_package', {
  org: 'auth0-samples',
  repo: 'auth0-node-passwordless-sample',
  path: ''
}) %>

You can perform passwordless authentication in your regular web app with your own custom UI using the [Auth0 JavaScript application library](/libraries/auth0js).

<%= include('_init-auth0js_v9', {redirectUri:true} ) %>

You must provide a way for the user to enter a address to which the email will be sent. Then you can begin the passwordless authentication as follows (assuming the name of your form input as `input.email`):

```js
function sendEmail(){
  var email = $('input.email').val();

  webAuth.passwordlessStart({
    connection: 'email',
    send: 'code',
    email: email
  }, function (err,res) {
    if (err) {
      // Handle error
    }
    // Hide the input and show the code entry screen
    $('.enter-email').hide();
    $('.enter-code').show();
  });
}
```

This will send an email to the provided address. The user must now enter the code they received into your custom UI. Then you can continue with the login as follows (assuming the name of your form inputs as `input.email` and `input.code`):

```js
function login(){
  var email = $('input.email').val();
  var code = $('input.code').val();

  webAuth.passwordlessVerify({
    connection: 'email',
    email: email,
    verificationCode: code
  }, function (err,res) {
    if (err) {
      // Handle error
    }
  });
};
```

If authentication is successful, the user will be redirected to the `redirectUri` specified in the Auth0 constructor.
