# Passwordless Authentication with Embedded Login

If you have strong reasons to not to use Universal Login, you can embed the login user interface in your application by using our SDKs to implement passwordless authentication. 

Depending on the kind of application you want to build, you'll need to implement it differently.

For Single Page Applications (e.g. Angular / React), refer to [Embedded Passwordless Login in Single Page Applications](/connections/passwordless/guides/embedded-login-spa).

For Native applications (iOS, Android, desktop applications) refer to [Embedded Passwordless Login in Native Applications](/connections/passwordless/guides/embedded-login-native). 

For Regular Web Applications (NodeJS, Java, Rails, .NET) please check [Embedded Passwordless Login in Regular Web Applications](/connections/passwordless/guides/embedded-login-webapps).
