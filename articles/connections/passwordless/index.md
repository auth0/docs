# Passwordless Connections

Passwordless connections allow users to login without the need of a password. These connections work by using an authentication channel like SMS messages or emails.

Passwordless authentication requires two steps:

1. Your app creates a **user** in Auth0 by registering an artifact (e.g. `phone_number` or `email`) provided by the user. A one-time **code** is then sent to the user by Auth0.

2. Your app validates the **code** entered by the user with Auth0, using the `phone_number` or `email` as the **username**.

## Passwordless with SMS and Twilio

This Passwordless connection uses SMS (sent via [Twilio](http://www.twilio.com)) as the authentication mechanism.

### Setup

#### 1. Open an account with Twilio

You will need a [Twilio Account SID](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/what-is-an-application-sid) and a [Twilio Auth Token](https://www.twilio.com/help/faq/twilio-basics/what-is-the-auth-token-and-how-can-i-change-it). These are the Twilio API credentials that Auth0 will use to send an SMS to the user.

#### 2. Configure the connection

Passwordless connections can be configured in the Auth0 dashboard, under [Connections > Passwordless](https://manage.auth0.com/#/connections/passwordless).

On the **SMS (Twilio)** page on Auth0, enter your **Twilio Account SID** and **Auth Token**. Enter the **From** phone number users will see as the sender of the SMS (also configurable in Twilio) and a **message**.

The `@@password@@` placeholder in the message template will be replaced with the one-time password that is sent in a text message to the user.

### Implementation 

To implement passwordless login, code your app to follow these steps:

1. Register the user using the [Auth0 serverside API](https://auth0.com/docs/api/v2#!/Users/post_users):

    ```
POST https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/users/
Authorization: Bearer {Auth0 APIv2 Token}
Content-Type: 'application/json'

{
  "connection":     "sms",
  "email_verified": false,
  "phone_number":   "+14251112222"
}
    ```
An APIv2 token can be generated with the [APIv2 explorer](https://auth0.com/docs/api/v2). The token must include the `create:users` scope.

2. Auth0 sends the SMS message you configured in the Auth0 dashboard to the specified phone number, including a one-time password that expires in 10 minutes.

3. Capture the one-time password submitted by the user and validate it with Auth0 using the [Resource Owner](/auth-api#!#post--oauth-ro) authentication endpoint:

    ```
POST https://${account.namespace}/oauth/ro
Content-Type: 'application/json'
{
  "client_id":   "${account.clientId}",
  "username":    "+14251112222",
  "password":    "ONE-TIME-CODE",
  "connection":  "sms",
  "grant_type":  "password",
  "scope":       "openid" //or "openid profile"
}
    ```

4. A successful authentication will result in a JWT sent in the response:

    ```
{
  "id_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJodHRwczovL3lvdXJuYW1lc3BhY2UuYXV0aDAuY29tLyIsInN1YiI6InNtc3w1NDRiZWJiODg3NjIzNDQ1NjcxZjVmN2ExIiwiYXVkIjoiaWNJTVBNamRmaGl1NDNuZWtqZjNqcjRlbmZpT2t5TkZ4dSIsImV4cCI6MTQxNDgxOTUyOSwiaWF0IjoxNDE0NzgzNTI5fQ.y4sIFl82DHFzli3GgT8Q2voZSADVQbcwpOx-DoAwmK4",
  "access_token": "eJ0ck9754nf46f9",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
    ```
