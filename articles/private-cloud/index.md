Users with requirements not met by the Auth0 Public Cloud may instead opt for a Private Cloud option.

Auth0 currently offers two Private Cloud deployment models:

* Private Cloud
* **Managed** Private Cloud, either hosted by Auth0 or hosted by you on an AWS environment and operated by Auth0 as a managed service

This overview covers specifically the **Private Cloud** option.

## What is the Private Cloud deployment model?

The Private Cloud provides you with a dedicated (or single-tenant) environment. You'll get enhanced performance, security, and compliance over what we include in our standard Public Cloud offering.

With the Private Cloud, Auth0 will handle a majority of the requirements for initial setup and maintenance. Afterward, you'll be on a set update pattern, typically no more frequent than every 30 days.

You'll get the ease of management that comes with using our Public Cloud combined with the power and security of our Managed Private Cloud.

## Private Cloud options and comparison

Auth0 offers two Private Cloud options to those for whom the Public Cloud is not an appropriate deployment option. Here is how the two Private Cloud deployment options compare to each other, as well as how they compare to the Enterprise (Public Cloud) option.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can you tell me more about "data residency?"**

Private Cloud customers can choose the region in which their data is stored. All data will remain within that region, which is crucial especially in instances where regulations prevent data from being sent outside the origin region.

**What is a single-tenancy deployment?**

Private Cloud deployments are isolated instances where none of a customer's resources (software and infrastructure) are shared with any other tenants. This offers increased performance, stability, and availability.

**What is the uptime guarantee upgrade?**

The standard SLA for the Private Cloud is 99.95%, but for those who need the highest level of uptime for their customers and applications, Auth0 offers an upgrade to 99.99% uptime.

**I'm a Public Cloud customer; is it possible to migrate my tenant(s) to the Private Cloud?**

Our Professional Services team can help you migrate from the Public Cloud to the Private Cloud as a billable project.
