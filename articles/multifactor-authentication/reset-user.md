# Resetting a user's multi-factor account

If a user has lost their mobile device they can use their recovery code to log in. If they do not have recovery code, they will need their tenant administrator to reset their multi-factor authentication.

To reset a user's multi-factor authentication:

1. Find and select the user in the [Users](${manage_url}/#/users) section of the dashboard.
2. Once you have selected the affected user, click on the **Actions** button on the top right of the screen.
3. Select **Reset Multi-factor Authentication** from the dropdown.
4. There will be a pop up box to confirm your decision.  Click **YES, RESET IT** to reset the user's MFA.

The next time the user logs in they will need to setup their MFA just like a new user.
