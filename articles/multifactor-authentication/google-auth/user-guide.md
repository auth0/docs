After entering your username and password, you will be prompted for a six digit code. Open the Google Authenticator app on your mobile device to find the correct code. If you use Google Authenticator for other applications as well, make sure you are using the code for the current application. After entering the six digit code you will be logged in.

## Troubleshooting

### If you do not have your mobile device

If you have lost your phone and are unable to finish the two-step authentication you will need to contact your system administrator for help accessing your account.

### If you forgot your password

If you forgot your password when you are trying to login, click **Don't remember your password?** underneath the login. Enter your email to receive an email that will contain a link to reset your password.

### Transaction Expiration

For logging in with Google Authenticator, there is a timeout that occurs with the passcode where it will expire. Try logging in again if you do not see a refreshed passcode in the app.
