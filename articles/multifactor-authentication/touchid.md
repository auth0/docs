::: warning
Touch ID with Auth0 has been deprecated, however you can still use it on a native app to protect the Refresh Token and achieve the effect you see in banking apps. You have to at least login once using credentials.
:::

Below you can find useful links in our documentation to handle Touch ID within Auth0.
