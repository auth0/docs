# Multifactor Authentication

Multifactor Authentication (MFA) is a method of verifying a user's identity by requiring them to present more than one piece of identifying information. This method provides an additional layer of security, decreasing the likelihood of unauthorized access. The type of information required from the user is typically two or more of the following:

* **Knowledge**: Something the user knows (e.g. a password)
* **Possession**: Something the user has (e.g. a cell phone)
* **Inheritance**: Something the user is (e.g. a fingerprint or retina scan)

Auth0 provides three ways of implementing MFA:

* Using Auth0's built-in support for one-time password authentication services: Google Authenticator and Duo Security.
* Configuring rules for Contextual MFA which allow you to define the conditions that will trigger additional authentication challenges, such as changes in geographic location or logins from unrecognized devices.
* Integration with a custom provider, such as **Yubikey**.

**NOTE:** For a detailed look at implementing MFA with **YubiKey**, see [Multifactor Authentication with YubiKey-NEO](/multifactor-authentication/yubikey).

## Using Auth0's Built-in Support

Auth0 provides built-in MFA support for Google Authenticator and Duo Security. You can enable MFA via the Multifactor Auth page of the Auth0 Management Portal.

### Google Authenticator

To integrate with Google Authenticator, click on its logo in the [Multifactor Auth](${uiURL}/#/multifactor) page of the Auth0 Management Portal.

The portal displays a code editing textbox containing the following code snippet for you to use:

```JS
function (user, context, callback) {

  var CLIENTS_WITH_MFA = ['REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CLIENT_ID'];
  // run only for the specified clients
  if (CLIENTS_WITH_MFA.indexOf(context.clientID) !== -1) {
    // uncomment the following if clause in case you want to request a second factor only from user's that have user_metadata.use_mfa === true
    // if (user.user_metadata && user.user_metadata.use_mfa){
      context.multifactor = {
        provider: 'google-authenticator',
        // issuer: 'Label on Google Authenticator App', // optional
        // key: '{YOUR_KEY_HERE}', //  optional, the key to use for TOTP. by default one is generated for you
        // ignoreCookie: true // optional, force Google Authenticator everytime this rule runs. Defaults to false. if accepted by users the cookie lasts for 30 days (this cannot be changed)
      };
    // }
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}
```

When you have finished editing the code snippet based on the requirements of your app, click **Save**.

### Duo Security

To integrate with Duo Security, click on its logo in the [Multifactor Auth](${uiURL}/#/multifactor) page of the Auth0 Management Portal.

The portal displays a code editing textbox containing the following code snippet for you to use:

```JS
function (user, context, callback) {

  var CLIENTS_WITH_MFA = ['{REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CLIENT_ID}'];
  // run only for the specified clients
  if (CLIENTS_WITH_MFA.indexOf(context.clientID) !== -1) {
    // uncomment the following if clause in case you want to request a second factor only from user's that have user_metadata.use_mfa === true
    // if (user.user_metadata && user.user_metadata.use_mfa){
      context.multifactor = {
        //required
        provider: 'duo',
        ikey: 'DIXBMN...LZO8IOS8',
        skey: 'nZLxq8GK7....saKCOLPnh',
        host: 'api-3....049.duosecurity.com',

        // optional. Force DuoSecurity everytime this rule runs. Defaults to false. if accepted by users the cookie lasts for 30 days (this cannot be changed)
        // ignoreCookie: true,

        // optional. Use some attribute of the profile as the username in DuoSecurity. This is also useful if you already have your users enrolled in Duo.
        // username: user.nickname,

        // optional. Admin credentials. If you provide an Admin SDK type of credentials. auth0 will update the realname and email in DuoSecurity.
        // admin: {
        //  ikey: 'DIAN...NV6UM',
        //  skey: 'YL8OVzvoeeh...I1uiYrKoHvuzHnSRj'
        // },
      };
    // }
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}
```

## Implementing Contextual MFA

The exact requirements for configuring Contextual MFA will vary. Below are sample snippets you might consider using as you customize your specific solution.

### Change the frequency of authentication requests

By default, Auth0 asks the user for MFA once per month. You can change this setting by changing the `ignoreCookie` field to `true`:

```JS
function (user, context, callback) {

  if (conditionIsMet()){
    context.multifactor = {
      ignoreCookie: true,
      provider: 'google-authenticator'
    };
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}
```

### Access from an extranet

You can have Auth0 request MFA from users whose requests originate from outside the corporate network:

```JS
function (user, context, callback) {

  if (IsExtranet()) {
    context.multifactor = {
      ignoreCookie: true,
      provider: 'google-authenticator'
    };
  }

  callback(null, user, context);

  function IsExtranet() {
    return !rangeCheck.inRange(context.request.ip, '10.0.0.0/8');
  }
}
```

### Access from a different device or location

If the user makes a request from an IP address that Auth0 has not already associated with them, you can configure Auth0 to request MFA.

```JS
function (user, context, callback) {

  var deviceFingerPrint = getDeviceFingerPrint();

  if (user.lastLoginDeviceFingerPrint !== deviceFingerPrint) {

    user.persistent.lasLoginDeviceFingerPrint = deviceFingerPrint;

    context.multifactor = {
      ignoreCookie: true,
      provider: 'google-authenticator'
    };
  }

  callback(null, user, context);

  function getDeviceFingerPrint() {

    var shasum = crypto.createHash('sha1');
    shasum.update(context.request.userAgent);
    shasum.update(context.request.ip);
    return shasum.digest('hex');

  }
}
```

## Use a Custom MFA Service

If you are using an MFA provider that does not have Auth0 built-in support or if you are using a service you have created, you can use the [redirect](/protocols#redirect-protocol-in-rules) protocol for the integration.

By using the redirect protocol, you interrupt the authentication transaction and redirect the user to a specified URL where they are asked for MFA. If authentication is successful, Auth0 will continue processing the request.

Some MFA options you can implement using the redirect protocol include:

* A one-time code sent via SMS
* A personally identifying question (e.g. about the user's parents, childhood friends, etc.)
* Integration with specialized providers, such as those that require hardware tokens

To use the redirect protocol, edit the `URL` field:

```JS
function (user, context, callback) {

  if (condition() && context.protocol !== 'redirect-callback'){
    context.redirect = {
      url: 'https://your_custom_mfa'
    };
  }

  if (context.protocol === 'redirect-callback'){
    //TODO: handle the result of the MFA step
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}
```

## Additional Notes

MFA does not work with the [Resource Owner](/protocols#oauth-resource-owner-password-credentials-grant) endpoint.

If you are using MFA for database connections that use [Popup Mode](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js#popup-mode), set `sso` to `true` when defining the options in [auth0.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.js#sso) or [Lock](/libraries/lock). If you fail to do this, users will be able to log in without MFA.

If you are using MFA after an authentication with one or more social providers, you may need to use your own application `ID` and `Secret` in the connection to the provider's site in place of the default Auth0 development credentials. For instructions on how to get the credentials for each social provider, please see the [Social Connections](/identityproviders#social) documentation.
