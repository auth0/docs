# Auth0 Guardian

Guardian is Auth0's multifactor authentication (MFA) application that provides a simple, safe way for you to implement MFA. The Guardian app is used for two-factor authentication when logging into an application, which helps create a more secure login. With two-factor authentication your users will always need their mobile device in order to login.
