If you attempt to send more than ten SMS to your device within an hour, you will see an error message about a rate limit exception. If you have exceeded the limit of ten, you will need to wait at least an hour from your first SMS send to send another message. Each hour after the first attempt you will gain one more message request maxing out at ten requests.
