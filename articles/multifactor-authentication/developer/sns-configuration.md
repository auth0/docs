# Configuring Amazon SNS

In order to receive push notifications from Guardian, it's necessary to override Guardian's default SNS settings.

To do this, go to the [multi-factor Auth](${manage_url}/#/guardian) section of the dashboard and click on the **Push Notifications** box.

Enable the switch to use a custom app and provide the following values for your configuration:

Name | Description
-----|------------
AWS Access Key Id | Your AWS access key id.
AWS Secret Access Key | Your AWS secret access key.
AWS Region | Your AWS application's region.
APNS ARN | The Amazon Resource Name for your [Apple Push Notification Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-apns.html).
GCM ARN | The Amazon Resource Name for your [Firebase Cloud Messaging Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/sns-mobile-application-as-subscriber.html).

Then click **SAVE**.
