# Guardian for iOS
The [Guardian for iOS Software Development Kit](https://github.com/auth0/GuardianSDK.iOS) allows developers to create iOS apps with Guardian functionality, providing easy and secure access to multifactor authentication with push notifications. For example, this toolkit gives you the power to build a 'white label' version of the Guardian application for your users, using your own look-and-feel.

More information can be found on Guardian [here](/multifactor-authentication/guardian). For general multifactor discussion, read more [here](/multifactor-authentication).

Get started using Guardian for iOS below, or, if you're looking for a specific document, try the listing of [additional documents](#additional-documents) related to Guardian for iOS.

## Requirements

The Guardian iOS SDK requires iOS 9.3+ or Swift 3.

## Installation

The Guardian iOS SDK is available through CocoaPods. To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod "GuardianSDK", "~> 0.1.0"
```

## Dashboard Settings

To enable Guardian Push Notifications for your users, go to the [Multifactor Auth](${manage_url}/#/guardian) section of the dashboard. Then toggle the **Push Notification** slider to enable it.

## SNS configuration

For your native application to receive push notifications from Guardian, you will need to override the default SNS settings. Follow the instructions [here](/multifactor-authentication/developer/sns-configuration).

## Using the SDK
`Guardian` is the core of the SDK. Import the library:

```swift
import Guardian
```

Set the domain for your specific tenant/url:

```swift
let domain = "tenant.guardian.auth0.com"
```

### Enroll

The link between the second factor (an instance of your app on a device) and an Auth0 account is referred to as an enrollment.

You can create an enrollment using the `Guardian.enroll` function. Obtain the enrollment information by scanning the Guardian QR code, and then use it to enroll the account:
```swift
let enrollmentUriFromQr: String = ... // the URI obtained from a Guardian QR code
let apnsToken: String = ... // the APNS token of this device, where notifications will be sent

Guardian
        .enroll(forDomain: domain, usingUri: enrollmentUriFromQr, notificationToken: apnsToken)
        .start { result in
            switch result {
            case .success(let enrollment): 
                // success, we have the enrollment data available
            case .failure(let cause):
                // something failed, check cause to see what went wrong
            }
        }
```

You must provide the `notificationToken`. This is the token required to send push notifications to the device using the Apple Push Notification service (APNs). Refrence their [docs](https://developer.apple.com/go/?id=push-notifications) for more information.

The notification token MUST be a String containing the 64 bytes (expressed in hexadecimal format) received on `application(:didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken)`

### Unenroll

To disable multifactor authentication you can delete the enrollment:
```swift
Guardian
        .api(forDomain: domain)
        .device(forEnrollmentId: enrollment.id, token: enrollment.deviceToken)
        .delete()
        .start { result in
            switch result {
            case .success: 
                // success, the enrollment was deleted
            case .failure(let cause):
                // something failed, check cause to see what went wrong
            }
        }
```

### Allow a login request

Once you have the enrollment in place, you will receive a push notification for each validation.

Guardian provides a method to parse the data received from APNs and return a `Notification` instance ready to be used.

For example, your `AppDelegate` might have something like this:

```swift
func application(application: UIApplication, didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [NSObject : AnyObject]) {
    // when the app is open and we receive a push notification

    if let notification = Guardian.notification(from: userInfo) {
        // we have received a Guardian push notification
    }
}
```

Once you have the notification instance, you can easily approve the authentication request by using the `allow` method. You'll also need the enrollment that you obtained previously. If there are multiple enrollments, be sure to use the one that has the same `id` as the notification (the `enrollmentId` property).

```swift
Guardian
        .authentication(forDomain: domain, andEnrollment: enrollment)
        .allow(notification: notification)
        .start { result in
            switch result {
            case .success: 
                // success, the enrollment was deleted
            case .failure(let cause):
                // something failed, check cause to see what went wrong
            }
        }
```

### Reject a login request

To deny an authentication request, use `reject` instead. You can optionally add a reason for the rejection, which will be available in the guardian logs.

```swift
Guardian
        .authentication(forDomain: domain, andEnrollment: enrollment)
        .reject(notification: notification)
        // or reject(notification: notification, withReason: "hacked")
        .start { result in
            switch result {
            case .success: 
                // success, the enrollment was deleted
            case .failure(let cause):
                // something failed, check cause to see what went wrong
            }
        }
```
