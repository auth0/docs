# Developer Resources for Guardian

At Auth0, we believe in giving developers the tools they need to get their jobs done. Guardian is no different, which is why we give several different options for working

## Building Custom Mobile Applications
Developers can build custom 'white-label' Guardian-like applications, or add multifactor functionality into their own applications.
* [Guardian SDK for Android](https://github.com/auth0/Guardian.Android)
* [Getting Started with Guardian for Android](/multifactor-authentication/developer/libraries/android)
* [Guardian SDK for iOS](https://github.com/auth0/GuardianSDK.iOS)
* [Getting Started with Guardian for iOS](/multifactor-authentication/developer/libraries/ios)

## Working with Guardian within your Application
Most often, administrators will manage multifactor configuration for an application, as seen [here](multifactor-authentication/guardian/admin-guide). For more advanced use cases, Guardian provides developers the ability to control user access directly.
* [Example Application using Guardian for Multifactor Authentication](https://github.com/auth0/guardian-example)
* [How to do 'Step-Up' Authentication with Guardian](/multifactor-authentication/developer/step-up-with-acr)

## Customizing the Guardian Widget
Apply the look-and-feel of your organization by working with our Guardian client libraries.
* [Client library for Auth0 Guardian](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-guardian.js)
* [Creating a Custom Guardian Widget](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-guardian.js/tree/master/example)
