# Developer Resources for Guardian

With Guardian, you can customize your users' multi-factor experience and even build applications on top of our multi-factor capabilities.

## Getting started with Guardian within your application

Generally you'll manage multi-factor configuration for applications from the Dashboard. For more advanced use cases, Guardian also provides direct control of user access.

## Customize the Guardian widget

Use the Guardian client libraries to customize the look-and-feel of the Guardian widget so it matches your organization.
