# Developer Resources for Guardian

At Auth0, we believe in giving developers the tools they need to get their jobs done. With Guardian, developers are able to customize their users' experience, and even build their own applications on top of our multifactor capabilities.

## Getting started with Guardian within your Application
Most often, administrators will manage multifactor configuration for an application, as seen [here](multifactor-authentication/guardian/admin-guide). For more advanced use cases, Guardian provides developers the ability to control user access directly.
* [Example Application using Guardian for Multifactor Authentication](https://github.com/auth0/guardian-example)
* [How to do 'Step-Up' Authentication with Guardian](/multifactor-authentication/developer/step-up-with-acr)

## Customizing the Guardian Widget
Apply the look-and-feel of your organization by working with our Guardian client libraries.
