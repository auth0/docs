# Duo for Developers

## Enabling Duo for MFA

To turn on Duo for two-step verification, first visit the [Multifactor Auth](${manage_url}/#/guardian) page from the dashboard. Then click on the link to use a different provider.

Then you can use the slider to turn on Duo.

### Customize Duo 

After you toggle the slider to enable using Duo, a portal displays a code editing textbox containing the following code snippet for you to use:

```JS
function (user, context, callback) {

  var CLIENTS_WITH_MFA = ['{REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CLIENT_ID}'];
  // run only for the specified clients
  if (CLIENTS_WITH_MFA.indexOf(context.clientID) !== -1) {
    // uncomment the following if clause in case you want to request a second factor only from user's that have user_metadata.use_mfa === true
    // if (user.user_metadata && user.user_metadata.use_mfa){
      context.multifactor = {
        //required
        provider: 'duo',
        ikey: 'DIXBMN...LZO8IOS8',
        skey: 'nZLxq8GK7....saKCOLPnh',
        host: 'api-3....049.duosecurity.com',

        // optional, defaults to true. Set to false to force DuoSecurity every time. 
        // See https://auth0.com/docs/multifactor-authentication/custom#change-the-frequency-of-authentication-requests for details
        allowRememberBrowser: false,

        // optional. Use some attribute of the profile as the username in DuoSecurity. This is also useful if you already have your users enrolled in Duo.
        // username: user.nickname,

        // optional. Admin credentials. If you provide an Admin SDK type of credentials. auth0 will update the realname and email in DuoSecurity.
        // admin: {
        //  ikey: 'DIAN...NV6UM',
        //  skey: 'YL8OVzvoeeh...I1uiYrKoHvuzHnSRj'
        // },
      };
    // }
  }

  callback(null, user, context);
}
```

### Changing the Required Fields

Required fields that you **must** replace to use Duo are: `ikey`, `skey` and `host`. 

1. To get these fields first [login to your Duo account](https://admin.duosecurity.com/login).

2. Click on the **Applications** section from the sidebar.

3. Then click on the button to **Protect an Application**.

4. Find the **Auth API** option from the list and then click **Protect this Application**.

5. Then you will be brought to the **Auth API** page under your Appications, you should see a **Details** section.

6. Under the **Details** section you will see: 

* **Integration key** - use this for your `ikey` field
* **Secret key** - use this for your `skey` field
* **API hostname**  - use this for your `host` field

Replace the three fields in the code snippet, and click **SAVE**.

## Other Customizations

### Use Duo only for Specified Users

#### Based on your Application
To use Duo for logins only for the specified clients, replace `REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_CLIENT_ID` field with the Client ID of the application you wish to use. You can find your Client ID(s) under the [Applications](${manage_url}/#/applications) section of the dashboard and then clicking the application you wish to use.

To use Duo for users of all your applications, you can comment or remove the sections regarding `CLIENTS_WITH_MFA`.

#### Specify users to use MFA
To only use Duo for MFA on users that have `user_metadata.use_mfa === true` uncomment this if block. This field can be updated using the [Management APIv2](/api/management/v2#!/Users/patch_users_by_id).

### Setting `allowRememberBrowser: false`
If `allowRememberBrowser: true` is set, or if the field is left unset, then users will not have to login with Duo everytime they login. The browser will save a cookie that will persist for 30 days and this cannot be undone.

### Changing the Username sent to Duo
To use a specific attribute of the profile as the username in DuoSecurity, uncomment `username: user.nickname` and change it to the attribute you wish to use. This is also useful if you already have your users enrolled in Duo.

### Setting Admin Credentials
If you provide an Admin SDK type of credentials then Auth0 will update the realname and email in Duo. To do this, replace the `ikey` and `skey` with the integration key and secret key.
