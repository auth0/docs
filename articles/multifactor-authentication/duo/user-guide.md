### Send me a Push
If you choose this option, you must have the Duo App installed on your device. The app will send you a push notification, choose Accept to login.

### Call me
If you choose this option, you will receive an automated call from Duo. Answer the call and press any key to finish logging in.

### Enter a Passcode
If you choose this option, you must have the Duo App installed on your device. Open the app on your device and then click on the key icon next to the name of the application you are logging into. This will reveal a six-digit code, enter this passcode and then click **Log In** to continue.

## Troubleshooting

### If you do not have your mobile device

If you have lost your phone and are unable to finish the two-step authentication you will need to contact your system administrator for help accessing your account.

### If you forgot your password

If you forgot your password when you are trying to login, click **Don't remember your password?** underneath the login. Enter your email to receive an email that will contain a link to reset your password.
