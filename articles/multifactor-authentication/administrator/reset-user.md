## Reset an MFA for a User

If a user has lost their mobile device, they will need their recovery code to be able to log in. If they have also lost their recovery code, you, as an administrator, will need to reset their MFA.

To reset a user's MFA:

1. Find and select the user in the [Users](${manage_url}/#/users) section of the dashboard.
2. Once you have selected the affected user, click on the **Actions** button on the top right of the screen. 
3. Select **Reset Multi Factor (Auth0)** from the dropdown.
4. There will be a pop up box to confirm your decision.  Click **YES, RESET IT** to reset the user's MFA.

The next time the user logs in they will need to re-setup their MFA just like a new user.
