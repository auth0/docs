## Disabling Guardian and other MFA

Guardian, and other types of MFA, can be disabled from the [Multifactor Auth](${manage_url}/#/guardian) section of the dashboard. Toggle the button to disabled for the type of MFA you wish to turn off. A confirmation popup will appear.

By disabling a type of MFA, you will un-enroll all your current users of that type of MFA. They will be asked to re-enroll next time they try to login. This action cannot be reverted.
