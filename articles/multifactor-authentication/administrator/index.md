# Guardian for Administrators 

Guardian is Auth0's multifactor authentication solution that provides a simple and secure way to implement MFA. When using Guardian with Auth0, users will be prompted for additional authentication from the Guardian mobile application, helping to provide a more secure login.

This page contains information on how to enable and configure Guardian as an administrator. Information geared toward developers and users can be found under [additional documents](#additional-documents).
