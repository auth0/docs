# Guardian for Administrators 

Guardian is Auth0's multifactor authentication (MFA) application that provides a simple, safe way for you to implement MFA. The Guardian app is used for two-factor authentication when logging into an application, which helps create a more secure login.  With two-factor authentication your users will always need their mobile device in order to login.

This page explains how to enable and use Push Notifications and SMS for MFA for signing in your users.

For information for your users on Guardian, how to download the app, and common questions, see: [How to Use the Guardian App](/multifactor-authentication/guardian/user-guide).
