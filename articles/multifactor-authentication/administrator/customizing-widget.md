## Customizing the Guardian Screen

You may change the logo and the friendly name that is displayed to your users. To do so, make the appropriate setting changes from the Guardian page's link to [Account Settings](${manage_url}/#/account). You can also reach the Account Settings page by clicking on your user name on the top right of the page and then selecting **Account Settings** from the dropdown menu.

 * **Friendly Name**: the name of the app that you want displayed to users
 * **Logo URL**: the URL that points to the logo image you want displayed to users

Auth0 recommends using a logo image that is at least 100x100 pixels, although an image that is 200x200 pixels ensures quality viewing in devices with Retina or high DPI displays.
