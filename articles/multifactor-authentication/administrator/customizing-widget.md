## Customizing the Guardian Screen

You may change the logo and the friendly name that is displayed to your users. To do so, make the appropriate setting changes from the Guardian page's link to [Account Settings](${manage_url}/#/account). You can also reach the Account Settings page by clicking on your user name on the top right of the page and then selecting **Account Settings** from the dropdown menu.

 * **Logo URL**: the URL that points to the logo image you want displayed to users
