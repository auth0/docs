## Before you start

Before you can use the MFA APIs, you'll need to:

* Enable the MFA grant type for your application. You can enable the MFA grant by going to [Applications > Your Application > Advanced Settings > Grant Types](${manage_url}/#/applications) and selecting MFA.
* Create a rule that sets Guardian as the MFA provider. For more information, see [Guardian for Administrators](/multifactor-authentication/administrator).
