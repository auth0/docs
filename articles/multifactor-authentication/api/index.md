# Multifactor Authentication API

With Auth0's multifactor authentication endpoints, you can configure and manage multifactor authentication for your applications.

- Implement MFA for trusted applications using the [Resource Owner Password Grant](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/grant/password).
- Let users add a new authenticator if they don't have an active one.
- Enable users to select the authenticator they want to use.
- List and delete authenticators
- Provide stronger authentication when refreshing tokens

## Limitations

Currently, [Hosted Login Pages](/hosted-pages/login) do not support multiple authenticators.
