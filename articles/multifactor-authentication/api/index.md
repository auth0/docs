# Multifactor Authentication API

With Auth0â€™s multifactor authentication (MFA) API, you can verify MFA through the `oauth/token` endpoint, allow users to enroll multiple authenticators, and let users select the authenticator they want to use. These endpoints are a flexible tool you can use when implementing MFA for trusted applications using the [Resource Owner Password Grant](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/grant/password).

## Limitations

Currently, [Hosted Login Pages](/hosted-pages/login) do not support multiple authenticators.
