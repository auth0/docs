# Using Auth0 with Windows App Store

This tutorial explains how to integrate Auth0 with a Windows App Store. `Auth0.Windows8.Cs` helps you authenticate users with any [Auth0 supported identity provider](identityproviders).

## Tutorial

### 1. Install Auth0.Windows8.Cs NuGet package

Use the NuGet Package Manager (Tools -> Library Package Manager -> Package Manager Console) to install the Auth0.Windows8.Cs package, running the command:

<pre><code>Install-Package Auth0.Windows8.Cs</pre></code>

### 2. Setting up the callback URL in Auth0

<div class="setup-callback">
<p>Go to the <a href="@@uiAppSettingsURL@@" target="_new">Application Settings</a> section in the Auth0 dashboard and make sure that <strong>Allowed Callback URLs</strong> contains the following value:</p>

<pre><code>https://@@account.namespace@@/mobile</pre></code>
</div>

### 3. Integration
There are three options to do the integration:

1. Using the [Auth0 Login Widget](login-widget2) inside a Web View (this is the simplest with only a few lines of code required).
2. Creating your own UI (more work, but higher control the UI and overall experience).
3. Using specific user name and password.

#### Option 1: Authentication using Login Widget

To start with, we'd recommend using the __Login Widget__. Here is a snippet of code to copy & paste on your project.
Since we are using `await` (.NET 4.5 or greater), your method needs to be `async`:

```csharp
using Auth0.SDK;

var auth0 = new Auth0Client(
	"@@account.namespace@@",
	"@@account.clientId@@");

var user = await auth0.LoginAsync();
/*
    Use this object to do wonderful things, e.g.:
      - get user email => user.Profile["email"].ToString()
      - get facebook/google/twitter/etc access token => user.Profile["identities"][0]["access_token"]
      - get Windows Azure AD groups => user.Profile["groups"]
      - etc.
*/
```

#### Option 2: Authentication with your own UI

If you know which identity provider you want to use, you can add a `connection` parameter and the user will be sent straight to the specified `connection`:

```csharp
var user = await auth0.LoginAsync("auth0waadtests.onmicrosoft.com")' // connection name here
```

> connection names can be found on Auth0 dashboard. E.g.: `facebook`, `linkedin`, `somegoogleapps.com`, `saml-protocol-connection`, etc.

#### Option 3: Authentication with specific user name and password (only for providers that support this)

```csharp
var user = await auth0.LoginAsync(
	"my-db-connection", 	// connection name here
	"username",
	"password");
```

#### Scope

Optionally you can specify the `scope` parameter. There are two possible values for scope today:

* __scope: "openid"__ _(default)_ - It will return, not only the `access_token`, but also an `id_token` which is a Json Web Token (JWT). The JWT will only contain the user id.
* __scope: "openid profile"__ - If you want the entire user profile to be part of the `id_token`.

## Accessing user information

The `Auth0User` has the following properties:

* `Profile`: returns a `Newtonsoft.Json.Linq.JObject` object (from [Json.NET component](http://components.xamarin.com/view/json.net/)) containing all available user attributes (e.g.: `user.Profile["email"].ToString()`).
* `IdToken`: is a Json Web Token (JWT) containing all of the user attributes and it is signed with your client secret. This is useful to call your APIs and flow the user identity.
* `Auth0AccessToken`: the `access_token` that can be used to access Auth0's API. You would use this for example to [link user accounts](link-accounts).
