## Sample Projects

If you would like to follow along with this Quickstart you can download the [seed project](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-aspnetcore-mvc-samples/tree/v1/Quickstart/00-Starter-Seed). This is just a regular ASP.NET MVC application with a home page and some of the NuGet packages which will be needed included. It also contains an `appSettings.json` file where you can configure the various Auth0-related settings for your application.

The final project after each of the steps is also available in the Quickstart folder of the [ASP.NET Core MVC Samples repository](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-aspnetcore-mvc-samples/tree/v1/Quickstart). You can find the final result for each step in the relevant folder inside the repository.
