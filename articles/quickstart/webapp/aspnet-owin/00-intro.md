## Sample Projects

If you would like to follow along with this quickstart, you can download a blank starter [seed project](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-aspnet-owin-mvc-samples/tree/master/Quickstart/00-Starter-Seed). This is just a regular ASP.NET MVC application with a home page and a `web.config` file where you can configure the various Auth0-related settings for your application.

Each of the steps in this guide contains a sample project download that shows the completion of the step. These projects can also be downloaded from the [ASP.NET (OWIN) MVC samples repository](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-aspnet-owin-mvc-samples) where you can find the final result for each step in the relevant folder.
