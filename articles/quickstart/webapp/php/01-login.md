## Integrate your PHP application

Let's create a sample application that authenticates a user with a PHP application. We'll take a simple approach here, appropriate for the written format. Still, you should check out the accompanying [Quickstart app on GitHub](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-php-web-app/) for a more robust example.

### Installing the PHP SDK

${snippet(meta.snippets.install)}

### Installing HTTP Client and Messaging Factories

The Auth0 PHP SDK supports many [PHP-FIG](https://www.php-fig.org) standards offering interoperability options with your architecture. Two of particular importance are [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/) and [PSR-18](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-18/). These standards allow you to plug-in networking components of your choice to handle messaging and requests. You will need to install compatible libraries in your project for the SDK to use.

The most prolific networking library for PHP is [Guzzle](https://guzzlephp.org), although many are available to pick from within the PHP community. Let's use Guzzle for this sample application. Once again, from your project directory, run the following shell command:

```sh
composer require guzzlehttp/guzzle guzzlehttp/psr7 http-interop/http-factory-guzzle
```

### Configuring the SDK

To begin, let's create a `.env` file within the root of your project directory to store our sample application's configuration and fill in the environment variables:

```sh
# The URL of our Auth0 Tenant Domain.
# If we're using a Custom Domain, be sure to set this to that value instead.
AUTH0_DOMAIN='https://${account.namespace}'

# Our Auth0 application's Client ID.
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID='${account.clientId}'

# Our Auth0 application's Client Secret.
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET='${account.clientSecret}'

# A long secret value we'll use to encrypt session cookies. This can be generated using `openssl rand -hex 32` from our shell.
AUTH0_COOKIE_SECRET='SEE COMMENT ABOVE'

# The base URL of our application.
AUTH0_BASE_URL='http://127.0.0.1:3000'
```

As PHP isn't able to read our `.env` file by itself, we'll want to install a library to help with that. Although we'll be using a particular library for our sample application's purposes, in a real world application any 'dotenv' loader of preference will work. From our project directory, let's run the following shell command to install the library:

```sh
composer require vlucas/phpdotenv
```

Next, let's create the PHP source file we'll be using for these code samples, `index.php`, and let's configure an instance of the Auth0 PHP SDK for our sample application:

```php
<?php

// Import the Composer Autoloader to make the SDK classes accessible:
require 'vendor/autoload.php';

// Load our environment variables from the .env file:
(Dotenv\Dotenv::createImmutable(__DIR__))->load();

// Now instantiate the Auth0 class with our configuration:
$auth0 = new \Auth0\SDK\Auth0([
    'domain' => $_ENV['AUTH0_DOMAIN'],
    'clientId' => $_ENV['AUTH0_CLIENT_ID'],
    'clientSecret' => $_ENV['AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET'],
    'cookieSecret' => $_ENV['AUTH0_COOKIE_SECRET']
]);
```

### Setting up your application routes

Modern PHP applications use a routing pattern to pass incoming HTTP requests to the code that handles them, determining what should happen when our users visit a particular "page" in our app. There is no single, correct way of implementing routing in your application, and there are many libraries to choose from to implement it. We'll be using one particular library for our sample application's purposes, but feel free to select your own in a real-world application.

From our project directory, let's run the following shell command to install the routing library:

```sh
composer require steampixel/simple-php-router
```

Next, let's open our `index.php` back up and give our application life. Start by configuring the route's our sample application will need:

```PHP
// ðŸ‘† We're continuing from the steps above. Append this to your index.php file.

// Import our router library:
use Steampixel\Route;

// This will respond to visits to '/', or so-called index route, where we'll display information about the user if they're logged in:
Route::add('/', 'onIndexRoute');

// This will respond to visits to '/login', where we'll prepare our users' sessions and redirect them to Auth0's Universal Login Page:
Route::add('/login', 'onLoginRoute');

// This will respond to visits to '/callback', where Auth0 will return our users after they've logged in. It's where our application can handle any session setup logic and decide where to redirect them to.
Route::add('/callback', 'onCallbackRoute');

// This will respond to visits to '/logout', where we'll clear our users' sessions and redirect them to Auth0's logout endpoint:
Route::add('/logout', 'onLogoutRoute');

// This tells our router that we've finished configuring our routes, and we're ready to begin routing incoming HTTP requests:
Route::run('/');
```

Let's also define our sample application's route's full URLs as named constants for convenience sake, as we'll need to reference them in a few places through our sample application:

```PHP
// ðŸ‘† We're continuing from the steps above. Append this to your index.php file.

define('ROUTE_URL_INDEX', rtrim($_ENV['AUTH0_BASE_URL'], '/'));
define('ROUTE_URL_LOGIN', ROUTE_URL_INDEX . '/login');
define('ROUTE_URL_CALLBACK', ROUTE_URL_INDEX . '/callback');
define('ROUTE_URL_LOGOUT', ROUTE_URL_INDEX . '/logout');
```

Now we can move on to adding our application's route handling logic, and the SDK integrations:

## Checking for a session

The Auth0 PHP SDK has a convenient method for checking if our user has authenticated and returned their profile, `getCredentials()`. Let's install this on our index route to print the user profile if they're logged in or report that they need to login.

```PHP
// ðŸ‘† We're continuing from the steps above. Append this to your index.php file.

function onIndexRoute() {
  $session = $auth0->getCredentials();

  if ($session === null) {
    // The user isn't logged in.
    echo 'Please <a href="/login">log in</a>.</p>';
    return;
  }

  // The user is logged in.
  print_r($session->user);

  echo 'You can now <a href="/logout">log out</a>.</p>';
}
```

We can access all the properties of our user's profile from the `user` property response, which is an array. So, for example, we can pull the user's nickname using `$session->user['nickname']`, or their email address from `$session->user['email']`. The structure is a [normalized user profile](https://auth0.com/docs/users/user-profile-structure), which you can learn more about [here](https://auth0.com/docs/users/normalized-user-profiles).

It's important to note that the content of the user profile will vary depending on the social provider(s) you use, so you should never assume that a particular value will always be there within your application logic. Use PHP language constructs like `isset` or null coalescence to gracefully handle a value's presence, or lack thereof, for example:

```PHP
// âœ‹ We don't need to include this in our sample application, it's just an example.
$name = $session->user['name'] ?? $session->user['nickname'] ?? $session->user['email'] ?? 'Unknown';
```

## Logging in

Now let's create our /login route, which will use the Auth0 PHP SDK's `login()` method to setup the user session and return a customized URL to Auth0's Universal Login Page for this user to login.

```PHP
// ðŸ‘† We're continuing from the steps above. Append this to your index.php file.

function onLoginRoute() {
    // It's a good idea to reset user sessions each time they go to login to avoid "invalid state" errors, should they hit network issues or other problems that interrupt a previous login process:
    $auth0->clear();

    // Setup the user's session and generate a ULP URL:
    $loginUrl = $auth0->login(ROUTE_URL_CALLBACK);

    // Finally, redirect the user to the Auth0 Universal Login Page.
    header("Location: " . $loginUrl);
    exit;
}
```

## Handling authentication callback

After our users return from authenticating with the Auth0's Universal Login Page, they'll return to our sample application at our callback route, `/callback` which we'll handle in this step.

When Auth0 passes our users back to us, it includes a few essential parameters in the query of the HTTP request. The Auth0 PHP SDK's `exchange()` method handles working with those, so finishing our authentication flow is straightforward:

```PHP
// ðŸ‘† We're continuing from the steps above. Append this to your index.php file.

function onCallbackRoute() {
    // Have the SDK complete the authentication flow:
    $auth0->exchange(ROUTE_URL_CALLBACK);

    // Finally, redirect our end user back to the / index route, to display their user profile:
    header("Location: " . ROUTE_URL_INDEX);
    exit;
}
```

## Logging out

Last but not least, let's properly handle logging our users out. The `logout()` method of the Auth0 PHP SDK handles clearing our sample application's session cookies, redirecting the user to Auth0's [/logout endpoint](https://auth0.com/docs/logout) (which logs out Auth0 session layer and any identify provider session layers), and then return the user to our / index route.

```PHP
// ðŸ‘† We're continuing from the steps above. Append this to your index.php file.

function onLogoutRoute() {
    // Setup the user's session and generate a ULP URL:
    $logoutUrl = $auth0->logout(ROUTE_URL_INDEX);

    // Finally, redirect the user to the Auth0 Universal Login Page.
    header("Location: " . $logoutUrl);
    exit;
}
```
