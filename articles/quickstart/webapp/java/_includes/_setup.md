## Integrate Auth0 in your Application

### Setup Dependencies

To integrate your Java application with Auth0, add the following dependencies:

- **javax.servlet-api**: is the library that allows you to create Java Servlets. You then need to add a Server dependency like Tomcat or Gretty, which one is up to you. Check our sample code for more information.
- **auth0-java-mvc-commons**: is the [Java library](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-java-mvc-common) that allows you to use Auth0 with Java for server-side MVC web apps. It generates the Authorize URL that you need to call in order to authenticate and validates the result received on the way back to finally obtain the [Auth0 Tokens](/tokens) that identify the user.

If you are using Gradle, add them to your `build.gradle`:

```java
compile 'javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:3.1.0'
compile 'com.auth0:mvc-auth-commons:1.+'
```

If you are using Maven, add them to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.auth0</groupId>
  <artifactId>mvc-auth-commons</artifactId>
  <version>1.+</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
  <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Configure your Java App

Your Java App needs some information in order to authenticate against your Auth0 account. The samples read this information from the deployment descriptor file `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`, but you could store them anywhere else. The required information is:

```xml
<context-param>
    <param-name>com.auth0.domain</param-name>
    <param-value>${account.namespace}</param-value>
</context-param>

<context-param>
    <param-name>com.auth0.clientId</param-name>
    <param-value>${account.clientId}</param-value>
</context-param>

<context-param>
    <param-name>com.auth0.clientSecret</param-name>
    <param-value>YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET</param-value>
</context-param>
```

The library we're using has this default behavior:
- Request the scope `openid`, needed to call the `/userinfo` endpoint later to verify the User's identity.
- Request the `code` Response Type and later perform a Code Exchange to obtain the tokens.
- Use the `HS256` Algorithm along with the Client Secret to verify the tokens.

But it also allows us to customize it's behavior:
* To use the `RS256` Algorithm along with the Public Key obtained dynamically from the Auth0 hosted JWKs file, pass a `JwkProvider` instance to the `AuthenticationController` builder.
* To use a different Response Type, set the desired value in the `AuthenticationController` builder. Any combination of `code token id_token` is allowed.
* To request a different `scope`, set the desired value in the `AuthorizeUrl` received after calling `AuthenticationController#buildAuthorizeUrl()`.
* To specify the `audience`, set the desired value in the `AuthorizeUrl` received after calling `AuthenticationController#buildAuthorizeUrl()`.
