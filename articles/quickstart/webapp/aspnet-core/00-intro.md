## Seed Project

If you want to follow along with this quickstart guide, you can download the [seed project](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-aspnetcore-mvc-samples/tree/master/Quickstart/00-Starter-Seed). The sample contains an ASP.NET MVC application with a home page and some NuGet packages. It also contains an `appSettings.json` file, where you can configure the Auth0-related settings for your application.

To see what the project looks like after each step, check the [Quickstart folder](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-aspnetcore-mvc-samples/tree/master/Quickstart) in the ASP.NET Core MVC Samples repository.
