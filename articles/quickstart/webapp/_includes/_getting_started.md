## Before you start

This guide walks you through setting up authentication and authorization in your ${library} apps with Auth0. If you are new to Auth0 we suggest you check our [Overview](/overview). For a complete picture of authentication and authorization for regular web apps, check our [Single Sign-On for Regular Web Apps](/architecture-scenarios/application/web-app-sso#authentication-flow) documentation.

Auth0 uses OAuth. If you want to learn more about the OAuth flows used by regular web apps, read about [Authentication for Server-side Web Apps](/application-auth/current/server-side-web).
