Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an important method for adding an extra layer of security to your authentication flow. With MFA enabled in your Auth0 account, the process to grant user access to your application will require an additional verification step. In addition to a username/password combination, a verification code generated by a mobile application or sent by SMS will be required. Currently, Auth0 supports several factors for MFA. For more details, see [Multi-factor Authentication in Auth0](/multifactor-authentication).
