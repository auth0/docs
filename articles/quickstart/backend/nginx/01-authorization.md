This tutorial and seed project have been tested with the following:
* Openresty 1.9.7.2

**Please follow the steps below to secure your existing API with an Nginx reverse-proxy that's configured to process JWT's generated by your Auth0 account.**

## Install the `nginx-jwt` script into your Nginx server

The [`nginx-jwt`](https://github.com/auth0/nginx-jwt) script is a Lua script that is designed to run on Nginx servers that have the [HttpLuaModule](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#readme) installed. But ultimately its dependencies require components available in the [OpenResty](http://openresty.org/) distribution of Nginx. Therefore, it is recommended that you use **OpenResty** as your Nginx server, and these instructions make that assumption.

1. Download the latest archive package from [releases](https://github.com/auth0/nginx-jwt/releases).
1. Extract the archive and deploy its contents to a directory on your Nginx server.
1. Specify this directory's path using ngx_lua's [lua_package_path](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#lua_package_path) directive:

```lua
# nginx.conf:

http {
    lua_package_path "/path/to/lua/scripts;;";
    ...
}
```

## Configure `nginx-jwt` with your Auth0 account

1. Export the `JWT_SECRET` environment variable on the Nginx host, setting it equal to your Client Secret.
1. Expose this environment variable to the Nginx server:

```lua
# nginx.conf:

env JWT_SECRET;
```

## Secure your API

Now, secure one or more locations that point to your backing service endpoints by using the [access_by_lua](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module#access_by_lua) directive to call the `nginx-jwt` script's [`auth()`](https://github.com/auth0/nginx-jwt#auth) function before executing any [proxy_* directives](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html):


```lua
# nginx.conf:

server {
    location /secure_this {
        access_by_lua '
            local jwt = require("nginx-jwt")
            jwt.auth()
        ';

        proxy_pass http://my-backend.com$uri;
    }
}
```

## Call Your API

You can now make requests against your secure API by providing the Authorization header in your requests with a valid JWT ID Token.

```har
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "http://localhost:8000/path_to_your_api",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer YOUR_ID_TOKEN_HERE" }
  ]
}
```
