This sample demonstrates how to check for a JWT in the `Authorization` header of an incoming HTTP request and verify that it is valid. The validity check is done using the **jwt** Gem within a custom `JsonWebToken` class. An `authenticate!` method is used to mark endpoints which require authentication through an incoming Access Token. If the token is valid, the resources which are served by the endpoint can be released, otherwise a `401 Authorization` error will be returned.

## Install the Dependencies

Install the **jwt** Gem.

```bash
gem `jwt`
bundle install
```

## Create a `JsonWebToken` Class

Create a class called `JsonWebToken` which decodes and verifies the incoming Access Token from the `Authorization` header of the request. The public key for your Auth0 tenant can be fetched to verify the token.

```rb
# lib/jwt/json_web_token.rb

# frozen_string_literal: true
require 'net/http'
require 'uri'

class JsonWebToken
  def self.verify(token)
    JWT.decode(token, nil,
               true, # Verify the signature of this token
               algorithm: 'RS256',
               iss: 'https://${account.namespace}/',
               verify_iss: true,
               # auth0_api_audience is the identifier for the API set up in the Auth0 dashboard
               aud: auth0_api_audience,
               verify_aud: true) do |header|
      jwks_hash[header['kid']]
    end
  end

  def self.jwks_hash
    jwks_raw = Net::HTTP.get URI("https://${account.namespace}/.well-known/jwks.json")
    jwks_keys = Array(JSON.parse(jwks_raw)['keys'])
    Hash[
      jwks_keys
      .map do |k|
        [
          k['kid'],
          OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(
            Base64.decode64(k['x5c'].first)
          ).public_key
        ]
      end
    ]
  end
end
```

## Define an `authenticate!` method

Create an `authenticate!` method to run before each endpoint which looks for the Access Token in the `Authorization` header of an incoming request. If the token is present, it should be passed to `JsonWebToken.verify`.

```rb
# lib/server_rs256.rb

def authenticate!
  # Extract <token> from the 'Bearer <token>' value of the Authorization header
  supplied_token = String(request.env['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION']).slice(7..-1)

  @auth_payload, @auth_header = JsonWebToken.verify(supplied_token)

rescue JWT::DecodeError => e
  halt 401, json(error: e.class, message: e.message)
end

# This route doesn't need authentication
get '/api/public' do
  json( message: 'Hello from a public endpoint! You don't need to be authenticated to see this.' )
end

get '/api/private' do
  authenticate!
  json( message: 'Hello from a private endpoint! You need to be authenticated to see this.' )
end
```

## Configure Scopes

The `JsonWebToken.verify` method above verifies that the Access Token included in the request is valid; however, it doesn't yet include any mechanism for checking that the token has the sufficient `scope` to access the requested resources.

Scopes provide a way for you to define which resources should be accessible by the user holding a given Access Token. For example, you might choose to permit `read` access to a `messages` resource if a user has a **manager** access level, or `write` access to that resource if they are an **administrator**.

To configure scopes in your Auth0 dashboard, navigate to [your API](${manage_url}/#/apis) and choose the **Scopes** tab. In this area you can apply any scopes you wish, including one called `read:messages`, which will be used in this example.

## Protect Individual Endpoints

To look for a particular `scope` in an Access Token, provide an array of required scopes and check if they are present in the payload of the token.

In this example the `SCOPES` array for the given key `/api/private-scoped` is intersected with the `scopes` contained in the payload of the Access Token to determine if it contains one or more items from the array.

```rb
# lib/server_rs256.rb

SCOPES = {
  '/api/private' => nil,
  '/api/private-scoped' => ['read:messages']
}

def authenticate!
  # Extract <token> from the 'Bearer <token>' value of the Authorization header
  supplied_token = String(request.env['HTTP_AUTHORIZATION']).slice(7..-1)

  @auth_payload, @auth_header = JsonWebToken.verify(supplied_token)

  halt 403, json(error: 'Forbidden', message: 'Insufficient scope') unless scope_included

rescue JWT::DecodeError => e
  halt 401, json(error: e.class, message: e.message)
end

def scope_included
  if SCOPES[request.env['PATH_INFO']] == nil
    true
  else
    # The intersection of the scopes included in the given JWT and the ones in the SCOPES hash needed to access
    # the PATH_INFO, should contain at least one element
    (String(@auth_payload['scope']).split(' ') & (SCOPES[request.env['PATH_INFO']])).any?
  end
end

# ...

get '/api/private-scoped' do
  authenticate!
  json( message: 'Hello from a private endpoint! You need to be authenticated and have a scope of read:messages to see this.' )
end
```

With this configuration in place, only `access_token`s which have a scope of `read:messages` will be allowed to access this endpoint.
