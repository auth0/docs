By default, your API will be set up to use RS256 as the algorithm for signing tokens. Since RS256 works by using a private/public keypair, tokens can be verified against the public key for your Auth0 account. This public key is accessible at <a href="https://$account.namespace/.well-known/jwks.json" target="_blank">https://${account.namespace}/.well-known/jwks.json</a>.
