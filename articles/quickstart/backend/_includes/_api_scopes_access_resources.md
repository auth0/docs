Scopes let you define which resources can be accessed by the user with a given access token. For example, you might choose to give the read access to the `messages` resource if a user has the manager access level, and a write access to that resource if they have the administrator access level. 

To configure scopes, in your Auth0 dashboard, in the [APIs](${manage_url}/#/apis) section, click the **Scopes** tab. Configure the scopes you need.
