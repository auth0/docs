To restrict access to the resources served by your API, a check needs to be made to determine whether the incoming request contains valid authentication information. There are various methods for including authentication information in a request, but for integration with Auth0, the server needs to check for a valid [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io). When users log into your application, they will receive both an `id_token` and an `access_token` which are both JWTs. The specific JWT that needs to be sent to your API is the `access_token`.
