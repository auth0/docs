## Add the Dependencies

Add **express-jwt** and **express-graphql** as dependencies.

## Configuration

<%= include('../_includes/_api_jwks_description_no_link') %>

Configure the **express-jwt** middleware to use the remote JWKS for your Auth0 account.

## Secure your API

In your Relay app, you serve a GraphQL object from a single endpoint, which is typically at `/graphql`. You can protect this endpoint globally with the `express-jwt` middleware.

## Send an Access Token from your Front End

When you send a request to the GraphQL endpoint, you need to include the user's Access Token as an `Authorization` header. This can be done by tapping into Relay's network layer and extending requests to include a header.
