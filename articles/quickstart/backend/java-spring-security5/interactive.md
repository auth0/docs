# Secure your API using Spring Security 5 and Auth0

Auth0 allows you to quickly add authorization to your application. This guide demonstrates how to integrate Auth0 with any new or existing Spring Boot application.

If you have not created an API in your Auth0 dashboard yet, use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 API or select an existing API that represents the project you want to integrate with.

Review [our getting started guide](get-started/auth0-overview/set-up-apis) to set up your first API through the Auth0 dashboard.

Each Auth0 API uses the API Identifier, which your application needs to validate the access token.

<%= include('../../../_includes/_api_auth_intro') %>

## Define permissions
<%= include('../_includes/_api_scopes_access_resources') %>

## Configure the sample project {{{ data-action=code data-code="application.yml#1:8" }}}

The sample project uses a `/src/main/resources/application.yml` file, which configures it to use the correct Auth0 **domain** and **API Identifier** for your API. If you download the code from this page it will be automatically configured. If you clone the example from GitHub, you will need to fill it in yourself.

| Attribute | Description|
| --- | --- |
| `auth0.audience` | The unique identifier for your API. If you are following the steps in this tutorial it would be `https://quickstarts/api`. |
| `spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri` | The value of the `iss` claim and the issuer URI of the resource server in the JWT issued by Auth0. Spring Security uses this property to discover the authorization server's public keys and validate the JWT signature. The value is Auth0 domain with an `https://` prefix and a `/` suffix (the trailing slash is important). |

## Install dependencies {{{ data-action=code data-code="application.yml#1:8" }}}

If you are using Gradle, you can add the required dependencies using the [Spring Boot Gradle Plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/gradle-plugin/reference/html/) and the [Dependency Management Plugin](https://docs.spring.io/dependency-management-plugin/docs/current/reference/html/) to resolve dependency versions:

```groovy
// build.gradle

plugins {
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.5.12'
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.0.9.RELEASE'
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server'
}
```

If you are using Maven, add the Spring dependencies to your `pom.xml` file:

```xml
// pom.xml

<parent>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.5.12</version>
    <relativePath/>
</parent>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
        <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server</artifactId>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

## Validate the audience {{{ data-action=code data-code="AudienceValidator.java#13:20" }}}

To validate the JWT, you also need to validate that the JWT is intended for your API by checking the `aud` claim of the JWT. Create a new class named `AudienceValidator` that implements the `OAuth2TokenValidator` interface and override the `validate` method to verify whether the required `audience` is present.

## Configure the resource server {{{ data-action=code data-code="SecurityConfig.java" }}}

To configure the application as a Resource Server and validate the JWTs, create a class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter`, add the `@EnableWebSecurity` annotation, and override the `configure` method

### Protect API endpoints

<%= include('../_includes/_api_endpoints') %>

The example below shows how to secure API methods using the `HttpSecurity` object provided in the `configure()` method of the `SecurityConfig` class. Route matchers restrict access based on the level of authorization required:

::: note
By default, Spring Security creates a `GrantedAuthority` for each scope in the `scope` claim of the JWT. This scope enables using the `hasAuthority("SCOPE_read:messages")` method to restrict access to a valid JWT that contains the `read:messages` scope.

If your use case requires different claims to make authorization decisions, see the [Spring Security Reference Documentation](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#oauth2resourceserver-authorization-extraction) to learn how to customize the extracted authorities.
:::

### Configure JWT Validator

Update the `SecurityConfig` class to configure a `JwtDecoder` bean that uses the `AudienceValidator`. The `auth0.audience` value from `application.yml` validates the `aud` claim. The `issuer-uri` value from `application.yml` verifies the `issuer`.

## Create the Domain Object {{{ data-action=code data-code="Message.java#1:11" }}}

To make your endpoint return a JSON, you can use a [POJO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object) (Plain Old Java Object). The member variables of this object is serialized into the key value for your JSON. Create a new class named `Message` as an example domain object to return during the API calls.

## Create the API controller {{{ data-action=code data-code="APIController.java" }}}

Create a new class named `APIController` to handle requests to the endpoints. The `APIController` has three routes as defined in the [Protect API Endpoints](/quickstart/backend/java-spring-security5/interactive/#configure-the-resource-server) section. For this example, allow all origins through `@CrossOrigin` annotation. Real applications should configure `CORS` for their use case.

## Run the application {{{ data-action=code data-code="APIController.java" }}}

To build and run the sample project, execute the `bootRun` Gradle task.

Linux or macOS:

```bash
./gradlew bootRun
```

Windows:

```bash
gradlew.bat bootRun
```

If you are configuring your own application using Maven and the [Spring Boot Maven Plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html), you can execute the `spring-boot:run` goal.

Linux or macOS:

```bash
mvn spring-boot:run
```

Windows:

```bash
mvn.cmd spring-boot:run
```

:::checkpoint-default

The sample application will be available at `http://localhost:3010/`. Read about how to test and use your API in the [Using Your API](/quickstart/backend/java-spring-security5/02-using) article.

:::checkpoint-failure
If your application did not launch successfully:
* Use the [Troubleshooting](/quickstart/backend/java-spring-security5/03-troubleshooting) section to check your configuration.
