# Add authorization to an Express.js API application
This guide demonstrates how to integrate Auth0 with any new or existing Express.js API application using the `express-oauth2-jwt-bearer` package.

If you haven't created an API in your Auth0 dashboard yet, you can use the interactive selector to create a new Auth0 API or select an existing API that represents the project you want to integrate with.

Alternatively, you can read [our getting started guide](get-started/auth0-overview/set-up-apis) that helps you set up your first API through the Auth0 dashboard.

Every API in Auth0 is configured using an API Identifier that your application code will use as the Audience to validate the access token.

## Define permissions
<%= include('../_includes/_api_scopes_access_resources') %>

## Install dependencies

First install the SDK using npm.

```bash
npm install --save express-oauth2-jwt-bearer
```

## Configure the middleware {{{ data-action=code data-code="server.js#1:10" }}}

Configure `express-oauth2-jwt-bearer` with your Domain and API Identifier.

The `checkJwt` middleware shown to the right checks if the user's Access Token included in the request is valid. If the token is not valid, the user gets a 401 Authorization error when they try to access the endpoints.

The middleware doesn't check if the token has the sufficient scope to access the requested resources.

## Protect API endpoints {{{ data-action=code data-code="server.js#12:32" }}}

To protect an individual route by requiring a valid JWT, configure the route with the `checkJwt` middleware constructed from `express-oauth2-jwt-bearer`.

You can configure individual routes to look for a particular scope. To achieve that, set up another middleware with the `requiresScope` method. Provide the required scopes and apply the middleware to any routes you want to add authorization to.

Pass the `checkJwt` and `requiredScopes` middlewares to the route you want to protect.

In this configuration, only Access Tokens with the `read:messages` scope can access the endpoint.
