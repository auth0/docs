## Install the Auth0 React SDK

Run the following command within your project directory to install the Auth0 React SDK:

```bash
npm install @auth0/auth0-react
```

The SDK exposes methods and variables that help you integrate Auth0 with your React application idiomatically using [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) or [Higher-Order Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/higher-order-components.html).
