## Install angular-auth0

Using auth0.js in your AngularJS application requires a thin wrapper called **angular-auth0**. Install it with npm or yarn.

```bash
# installation with npm
npm install --save angular-auth0

# installation with yarn
yarn add angular-auth0
```

Once **angular-auth0** is installed, add it to your build system or bring it in to your project as a script tag.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="node_modules/angular-auth0/dist/angular-auth0.js"></script>
```
