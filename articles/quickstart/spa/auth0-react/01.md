## Install the Auth0 React SDK

Run the following command within your project directory to install the Auth0 React SDK:

```bash
npm install @auth0/auth0-react
```

The SDK exposes methods and variables that help you integrate Auth0 with your React application idiomatically using React Hooks or Higher-Order Components.

### Configure the Auth0Provider component

Under the hood, the Auth0 React SDK uses [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to manage the authentication state of your users and to expose helpful utility methods. One way to integrate Auth0 with your React app is to wrap your root component with an `Auth0Provider` that you can import from the SDK.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { Auth0Provider } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Auth0Provider
    domain="${account.namespace}"
    clientId="${account.clientId}"
    redirectUri={window.location.origin}
  >
    <App />
  </Auth0Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

The `Auth0Provider` component takes the following props:

- `domain` and `clientId`: The values of these properties correspond to the "Domain" and "Client ID" values present under the "Settings" of the single-page application that you registered with Auth0.

:::note
If you are using a [custom domain with Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), the value of the domain prop is the value of your custom domain instead of the value reflected in the "Settings" tab.
:::

- `redirectUri`: The URL to where you'd like to redirect your users after they authenticate with Auth0. 

Once configured, `Auth0Provider` will store the authentication state of your users, the state of the SDK (is Auth0 ready to use?), and provide you with helper methods to log in and log out your users, which you can access using the `useAuth0()` hook.

The SDK integration with React is complete. Run your app to verify that everything is working without any errors.

## Add Login to Your Application

The Auth0 React SDK gives you tools to easily create functionality to log in your users to your React application, such as a button or a link. After you have configured the `Auth0Provider`, use the `useAuth0` hook to access the `loginWithRedirect` function. Calling this will redirect your application to the Universal Login Page, where your users are authenticated, before returning to your application.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

const LoginButton = () => {
  const { loginWithRedirect } = useAuth0();

  return <button onClick={() => loginWithRedirect()}>Log In</button>;
};

export default LoginButton;
```

:::note
This guide focuses on using the `useAuth0()` custom React Hook. If you are using class components, check out [these samples using the `withAuth0()` higher-order component] [link to class component samples].  
:::

:::panel Checkpoint
Add the `LoginButton` button to your application. When you click it, verify that your React application redirects you to the [Auth0 Universal Login](https://auth0.com/universal-login) and that you can now log in or sign up using a simple username and password or a social provider. Once that's complete, Auth0 will redirect you back to your application using the value of the `redirectUri` that you used to configure the `Auth0Provider`.

:::note
The Google social provider is enabled by default on new tenants. Auth0 offers you developer keys to test logging in with a [social identity provider](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/identity-providers-social). However, these developer keys have some limitations that may cause your app to behave differently. For more details on this and on how to fix it, read on [Test Social Connections with Auth0 Developer Keys](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/devkeys#limitations-of-developer-keys).

## Add Logout to Your Application

Now that you can log in to your app, you also need a way to log out. Use the `useAuth0` hook once again to access the `logout` function, which, when called, redirect your users to Auth0's logout URL, before immediately returning to your application.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

const LogoutButton = () => {
  const { logout } = useAuth0();

  return <button onClick={() => logout()}>Log Out</button>;
};

export default LogoutButton;
```

:::panel Checkpoint
Add the `LogoutButton` button to your application. When you click it, verify that your React application redirects you the address you specified as one of the "Allowed Logout URLs", and that you are no longer logged in to your app.
:::

## Show User Profile Information

The Auth0 React SDK helps you retrieve the profile information associated with logged-in users quickly in whatever component you need it, such as their name or profile picture, to personalize a page. The profile information is available through the `user` object exposed by the `useAuth0()` custom React Hook. Take this `Profile` component as an example:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

const Profile = () => {
  const { user, isAuthenticated } = useAuth0();

  return (
    isAuthenticated && (
      <div>
        <img src={user.picture} alt={user.name} />
        <h2>{user.name}</h2>
        <p>{user.email}</p>
      </div>
    )
  );
};

export default Profile;
```

The `user` property contains sensitive information and artifacts related to the user's identity. As such, its availability depends on the user's authentication status. To prevent any rendering errors, use the `isAuthenticated` property from `useAuth0` to check if the user is authenticated before you render any component that consumes the `user` property.

:::panel Checkpoint
Verify that you can display the `user.name` or any other of the `user` properties within a component correctly when the user is authenticated.
