## Install the Auth0 React SDK

Run the following command within your project directory to install the Auth0 React SDK:

```bash
npm install @auth0/auth0-react
```

The SDK exposes methods and variables that help you integrate Auth0 with your React application organically using React Hooks or High-Order Components.

> This guide focuses on using the `useAuth0()` custom React Hook. If you are using class components, check out [these samples using the `withAuth0()` high-order component] [link to class component samples].  

## Configure the Auth0 React SDK

Under the hood, the Auth0 React SDK uses [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to manage the authentication state of your users and to expose helpful utility methods. One way to integrate Auth0 with your React app is to wrap your root component with an `Auth0Provider` that you can import from the SDK.

```javascript
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import App from "./App";
import { Auth0Provider } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

ReactDOM.render(
  <Auth0Provider
    domain="${account.namespace}"
    clientId="${account.clientId}"
    redirectUri={window.location.origin}
  >
    <App />
  </Auth0Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

The `Auth0Provider` component takes the following props:

- `domain` and `clientId`: The values of these properties correspond to the "Domain" and "Client ID" values present under the "Settings" of the single-page application that you registered with Auth0.

> If you are using a [custom domain with Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), the value of the domain prop is the value of your custom domain instead of the value reflected in the “Settings” tab.

- `redirectUri`: The URL to where you'd like to redirect your users after they authenticate with Auth0. 

Once configured, `Auth0Provider` will store the authentication state of your users, the state of the SDK (is Auth0 ready to use?), and provide you with helper methods to log in and log out your users, which you can access using the `useAuth0()` hook.

## Add Login and Logout Buttons to Your App

The Auth0 React SDK makes it easy to create functionality to log in or log out your users from your React application, such as a button or link. After you have configured the `Auth0Provider`, you can access the following boolean flags and methods within any component where you need to implement that functionality:

- `isLoading`: Returns `false` once Auth0 has been initialized and it's ready to use.

- `isAuthenticated`: Returns `true` if the Auth0 authentication server has authenticated the user.

- `loginWithRedirect()`: Takes your users to the [Auth0 Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login) page and back to your application once they log in or sign up.

- `logout()`: Logs out the user from your application.

Combining these constructs, you can create login and logout buttons as follows:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

function App() {
  const { isAuthenticated, isLoading, loginWithRedirect, logout } = useAuth0();
  return (
    <div className="App">
      {isLoading ? (
        <h2>Loading...</h2>
      ) : (
        <>
          {isAuthenticated ? (
            <button onClick={() => logout()}>Log Out</button>
          ) : (
            <button onClick={() => loginWithRedirect()}>Log In</button>
          )}
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

The `App` component displays a "Loading..." message while the SDK determines if the user is already logged in. Once the initialization is complete, the component renders a "Log In" button if Auth0 has not authenticated the user yet; otherwise, it renders a "Log Out" button.

When you click on the "Log in" button, your React app redirects you to the [Auth0 Universal Login](https://auth0.com/universal-login) page where Auth0 will do what is needed to guarantee the user's identity.

By using [Auth0 Universal Login](https://auth0.com/docs/universal-login), you don't have to do any integration work to handle the various flavors of authentication. You can log in or sign up using a simple username and password or a social provider such as Google, which is enabled by default on new tenants.

> Auth0 offers you developer keys to test logging in with a [social identity provider](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/identity-providers-social). However, these developer keys have some limitations that may cause your app to behave differently. For more details on this and on how to fix it, read on [Test Social Connections with Auth0 Developer Keys](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/devkeys#limitations-of-developer-keys).

Once you log in or sign up using any method you prefer, Auth0 will redirect you back to your application using the value of the `redirectUri` that you used to configure the `Auth0Provider`.

## Get User Profile Information

The Auth0 React SDK helps you retrieve the profile information associated with logged-in users quickly in whatever component you need it, such as their name or profile picture, to personalize a page. The profile information is available through the `user` object exposed by the `useAuth0()` custom React Hook. Take this `Profile` component as an example:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { useAuth0 } from "@auth0/auth0-react";

const Profile = () => {
  const { user } = useAuth0();

  return (
    <div>
      <img src={user.picture} alt={user.name} />
      <h2>{user.name}</h2>
      <p>{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Profile;
```

The `user` property contains sensitive information and artifacts related to the user's identity. As such, its availability depends on the user’s authentication status. To prevent any rendering errors, check if Auth0 has authenticated the user before you render any component that consumes the `user` property. Take this [React Fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) as an example:

```javascript
<>
  {isAuthenticated ? (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => logout()}>Log Out</button>
      <Profile />
    </>
  ) : (
    <button onClick={() => loginWithRedirect()}>Log In</button>
  )}
</>
```
