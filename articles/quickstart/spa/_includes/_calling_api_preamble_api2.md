The focus of this guide is to show you how to configure the SDK to call APIs protected by OAuth 2. Instead of creating a demo API to test the client-server connection, you'll use the <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/api#management-api" target="_blank">Auth0 Management API</a>, which comes bundled with your Auth0 tenant. However, you can adapt this guide to work with any API that you are securing with Auth0.
