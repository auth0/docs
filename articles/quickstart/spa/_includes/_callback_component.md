When a user logs into your application with the Lock widget, what's really happening is that a call is being made to Auth0. In the case of username and password authentication, the user's credentials are sent and verified. For social authentication, the user will be redirected to the social identity provider they have chosen to authenticate with, after which they will be redirected to your application.

There are two ways that an authentication transaction happens. With username and password authentication, an XHR request is made from your application to Auth0 and and the result--either the tokens issued for the user or an error--is returned in the response. Social authentication, however, is a redirect-based transaction, meaning your application will fully reload once the transaction completes.

Redirect-based flows can cause undesireable user experiences in single page apps. When the page first reloads, the user will temporarily be in an unauthenticated state, and your UI will reflect this. To proivde a cleaner UX, you can optionally provide a dedicated route to use as the default location that the user will be redirected to once they have authenticated. The implementation of this route is at your discretion, but it really doesn't need to be anything more than some kind of loading indicator. After all, it's just a temporary place for the user to sit while they wait for the application to sort out the authentication state.
