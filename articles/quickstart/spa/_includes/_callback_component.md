You can select any URL in your application for your users to return to. We recommend creating a dedicated callback route. 
If you create a single callback route:
* You don't have to whitelist many, sometimes unknown, callback URLs.
* You can display a loading indicator while the application sets up a client-side session.
* Matching to an exact callback URL is recommended and greatly reduces the risk of abuse
