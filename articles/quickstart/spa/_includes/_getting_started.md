## Before you start

This guide walks you through setting up authentication and authorization in your ${library} apps with Auth0. If you are new to Auth0, check our [Overview](/overview). For a complete picture of authentication and authorization for all Single Page Applications, check our [SPA + API documentation](/architecture-scenarios/application/spa-api).

Auth0 uses OAuth. If you want to learn more about the OAuth flows used by Single Page Applications, read about [Authentication for Client-side Web Apps](/application-auth/current/client-side-web).
