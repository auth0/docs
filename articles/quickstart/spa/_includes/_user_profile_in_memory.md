A local `userProfile` member is included in the service which is intended to hold the `profile` that comes back from the `getProfile` call. As will be seen below, this example will utilize a dedicated profile area which will call `getProfile` when initialized. The `userProfile` member is included here so that the user's information can be held in memory after it is first retrieved, preventing the need for calls to `getProfile` every time the area is initialized. This behavior isn't required, but it can help to provide a better user experience.
