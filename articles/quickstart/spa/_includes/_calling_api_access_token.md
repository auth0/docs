To access secured resources from your API, the authenticated user's `access_token` needs to be included in requests that are sent to it. This is typically accomplished either by sending the `access_token` in an `Authorization` header using the `Bearer` scheme, or by storing the token in a cookie so that it is included in all requests to your server. These example will focus on the former implementation, but both approaches are valid.
