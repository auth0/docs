## Integrate Auth0 in your Application

Use the [Auth0 SPA SDK](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js) library to integrate Auth0 into your application. You can either install the library as a dependency in your application, or load it from CDN.

### Install as a dependency

You can install the Auth0 SPA SDK as a dependency of your application, useful if you're using a build system such as [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). You can do this using `npm` or `yarn`.

```bash
# installation with npm
npm install --save @auth0/auth0-spa-js

# installation with yarn
yarn add @auth0/auth0-spa-js
```

Once the Auth0 SPA SDK is installed, reference it using an import statement at the entrypoint of your application ():

```js
import createAuth0Client from '@auth0/auth0-spa-js';
```

### Reference the CDN
 
Alternatively, if you do not use a package manager such as Webpack, you can retrieve the Auth0 SPA SDK from Auth0's CDN.

```html
<script src="${auth0spajs_url}"></script>
```

<%= include('../../../libraries/_includes/_spa_js_faq') %>
