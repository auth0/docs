Auth0 enables the Google social provider by default on new tenants and offers you developer keys to test logging in with <a href="/connections/identity-providers-social" target="_blank">social identity providers</a>. However, these developer keys have some limitations that may cause your application to behave differently. For more details on what this behavior may look like and how to fix it, consult the <a href="/connections/social/devkeys#limitations-of-developer-keys" target="_blank">Test Social Connections with Auth0 Developer Keys</a> document.
