Most applications display profile information to authenticated users. Auth0 provides a `/userinfo` endpoint for that. When you send an Access Token to the endpoint, it returns a JSON object with information about the user. The information stored in that object depends on how the user logged in to your application. 

To learn more about the information returned by the `/userinfo` endpoint, see the [/userinfo endpoint documentation](/api/authentication#get-user-info).
