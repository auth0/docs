Most applications have a requirement to retrieve and show profile information to the authenticated user. Auth0 provides a `/userinfo` endpoint which, when sent an `access_token`, will respond with a JSON object containing information about the user. The specific user information that will be contained in this object will vary depending on how the user logged into your application. For more information about which fields are returned under which circumstances, see the [documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api/authentication#get-user-info) for the `/userinfo` endpoint.
