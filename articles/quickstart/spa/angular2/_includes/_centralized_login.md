## Add Authentication with Auth0

<%= include('../../_includes/_login_preamble', { library: 'Angular 2+' }) %>

## Create an Authentication Service

The best way to manage and coordinate the tasks necessary for user authentication is to create a reusable service. With the service in place, you'll be able to call its methods throughout your application. The name for it is at your discretion, but in these examples it will be called `AuthService` and the filename will be `auth.service.ts`. An instance of the `WebAuth` object from **auth0.js** can be created in the service.

Create a service and instantiate `auth0.WebAuth`. Provide a method called `login` which calls the `authorize` method from auth0.js.

```ts
// src/app/auth/auth.service.ts

import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Router } from '@angular/router';
import 'rxjs/add/operator/filter';
import * as auth0 from 'auth0-js';

@Injectable()
export class AuthService {

  auth0 = new auth0.WebAuth({
    clientID: '${account.clientId}',
    domain: '${account.namespace}',
    responseType: 'token id_token',
    audience: 'https://${account.namespace}/userinfo',
    redirectUri: 'http://localhost:4200/callback',      
    scope: 'openid'
  });

  constructor(public router: Router) {}

  public login(): void {
    this.auth0.authorize();
  }

}
```

::: note
**Checkpoint:** Try calling the `login` method from somewhere in your application. This could be from a button click or in some lifecycle event, just something that will trigger the method so you can see the login page.

### Finish Out the Service

Add some additional methods to the `AuthService` to fully handle authentication in the app.

```ts
// src/app/auth/auth.service.ts

// ...
@Injectable()
export class AuthService {

  // ...
  public handleAuthentication(): void {
    this.auth0.parseHash((err, authResult) => {
      if (authResult && authResult.accessToken && authResult.idToken) {
        window.location.hash = '';
        this.setSession(authResult);
        this.router.navigate(['/home']);
      } else if (err) {
        this.router.navigate(['/home']);
        console.log(err);
      }
    });
  }

  private setSession(authResult): void {
    // Set the time that the access token will expire at
    const expiresAt = JSON.stringify((authResult.expiresIn * 1000) + new Date().getTime());
    localStorage.setItem('access_token', authResult.accessToken);
    localStorage.setItem('id_token', authResult.idToken);
    localStorage.setItem('expires_at', expiresAt);
  }

  public logout(): void {
    // Remove tokens and expiry time from localStorage
    localStorage.removeItem('access_token');
    localStorage.removeItem('id_token');
    localStorage.removeItem('expires_at');
    // Go back to the home route
    this.router.navigate(['/']);
  }

  public isAuthenticated(): boolean {
    // Check whether the current time is past the
    // access token's expiry time
    const expiresAt = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('expires_at'));
    return new Date().getTime() < expiresAt;
  }

}
```

The service now includes several other methods for handling authentication.

* `handleAuthentication` - looks for an authentication result in the URL hash and processes it with the `parseHash` method from auth0.js
* `setSession` - sets the user's `access_token`, `id_token`, and a time at which the `access_token` will expire
* `logout` - removes the user's tokens from browser storage
* `isAuthenticated` - checks whether the expiry time for the `access_token` has passed

### About the Authentication Service

<%= include('../../_includes/_auth_service_method_description_auth0js') %>

## Provide a Login Control

Provide a template with controls for the user to log in and log out.

```html
<!-- src/app/app.component.html -->

<nav class="navbar navbar-default">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Auth0 - Angular</a>

      <button
        class="btn btn-primary btn-margin"
        routerLink="/">
          Home
      </button>

      <button
        class="btn btn-primary btn-margin"
        *ngIf="!auth.isAuthenticated()"
        (click)="auth.login()">
          Log In
      </button>

      <button
        class="btn btn-primary btn-margin"
        *ngIf="auth.isAuthenticated()"
        (click)="auth.logout()">
          Log Out
      </button>

    </div>
  </div>
</nav>

<main class="container">
  <router-outlet></router-outlet>
</main>
```

::: note
This example uses Bootstrap styles, but that's unimportant. Use whichever style library you like, or don't use one at all.
:::

The `click` events on the **Log In** and **Log Out** buttons make the appropriate calls to the `AuthService` to allow the user to log in and log out. Notice that these buttons are conditionally hidden and shown depending on whether or not the user is currently authenticated.

When the **Log In** button is clicked, the user will be redirected to Auth0's hosted login page.

<%= include('../../_includes/_hosted_login_customization' }) %>

## Process the Authentication Result

When a user authenticates at Auth0's hosted login page and is then redirected back to your application, their authentication information will be contained in a URL hash fragment. The `handleAuthentication` method in the `AuthService` is responsbile for processing the hash.

Call `handleAuthentication` in your app's root component so that the authentication hash fragment can be processed when the app first loads after the user is redirected back to it.

```ts
// src/app/app.component.ts

import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { AuthService } from './auth/auth.service';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {

  constructor(public auth: AuthService) {
    auth.handleAuthentication();
  }

}
```

## Add a Callback Component

Using Auth0's hosted login page means that users are taken away from your application to a page hosted by Auth0. After they successfully authenticate, they are returned to your application where a client-side session is set for them.

<%= include('../../_includes/_callback_component') %>

Create a component named `CallbackComponent` and populate it with a loading indicator.

```html
<!-- app/callback/callback.html -->

<div class="loading">
  <img src="assets/loading.svg" alt="loading">
</div>
```

::: note
This example assumes some kind of loading spinner is available in an `assets` directory. See the downloadable sample for a demonstration.
:::

After authentication, users will be taken to the `/callback` route for a brief time where they will be shown a loading indicator. During this time, their client-side session will be set, after which they will be redirected to the `/home` route.

::: note
This example assumes you are using path-based routing which Angular defaults to. If you are using hash-based routing with `{ useHash: true }`, you won't be able to specify a dedicated callback route because the URL hash will be used to hold the user's authentication information.

## Embedded Login

Auth0's hosted login page provides the fastest, most secure, and most feature-rich way to implement authentication in your app. If required, the Lock widget can also be embedded directly into your application, but certain features such as single sign-on won't be accessible. It is highly recommended that you use the hosted login page (as covered in this tutorial), but if you wish to embed the Lock widget directly in your application, follow the [Embedded Login sample](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-angular-samples/tree/embedded-login/01-Embedded-Login).
