## Before you Start

Before you continue with this tutorial, it is assumed that:
* You have an [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) account, which is a paid account with Apple. (There is no free trial available unless you are part of their [iOS Developer University Program](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/)).
* You have configured your Auth0 tenant and application client to enable **Sign In With Apple** to work. See [Add Sign In with Apple to Your Native App](/articles/connections/references/apple-native/guides/add-siwa-to-native-app) for details on how to do this.
