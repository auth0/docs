## Before You Start

This tutorial describes how to implement the native [Sign In With Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/) introduced in iOS 13. Alternatively check out the [iOS Swift Login tutorial](/quickstart/native/ios-swift) for Web Authentication with Auth0.

Before you start, you'll need:
* An [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) account, which is a paid account with Apple. There is no free trial available unless you're in the [iOS Developer University Program](https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/).
* To configure your Auth0 tenant and application client to enable **Sign In With Apple**. See [Add Sign In with Apple to Your Native App](/connections/apple-siwa/add-siwa-to-native-app) for details on how to do this.
