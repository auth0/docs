::: note
It is recommend in order to make the most of all the features in the [Auth0.swift](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) toolkit to start with the [iOS Swift QuickStart](/quickstart/native/ios-swift)
:::

This multistep quickstart guide will walk you through managing authentication in your iOS Objective-C apps with Auth0.

## About the Sample Applications

Each step within this quickstart guide (starting with **Login**) contains a downloadable sample which demonstrates the topic being covered. Within each of these samples, you will find an appropriate application to demonstrate the features discussed in the chapter.

## Auth0 Dependencies

Each tutorial will require you to use the [Auth0.swift](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) toolkit.

A brief description:

- [**Auth0.swift**](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) is a toolkit that lets you communicate efficiently with many the [Auth0 API](/api/info) functions and enables you to integrate the Login.

## Create an Application

If you haven't already done so, create a new application in your [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings) and choose **Native**.
