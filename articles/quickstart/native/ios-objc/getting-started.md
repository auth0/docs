:::note
It is recommend in order to make the most of all the features in the [Auth0.swift](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) toolkit to start with the [iOS Swift QuickStart](/quickstart/native/ios-swift)
:::

This multistep quickstart guide will walk you through managing authentication in your iOS Objective-C apps with Auth0.

## About the Sample Applications

Each step within this quickstart guide (starting with **Login**) contains a downloadable sample which demonstrates the topic being covered. Within each of these samples, you will find an appropriate application to demonstrate the features discussed in the chapter.
All samples will use a Hybrid project (Objective-C & Swift). For more information, please check [this guide](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/MixandMatch.html) from Apple.

## Auth0 Dependencies

Each tutorial will require you to use the [Auth0.swift](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) toolkit.

A brief description:

- [**Auth0.swift**](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) is a toolkit that lets you communicate efficiently with many of the [Auth0 API](/api/info) functions and enables you to integrate the Login.

## Create a Client

If you haven't already done so, create a new client application in your [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings) and choose **Native**.
