This quickstart guide walks you through managing authentication with Auth0 in your iOS Objective-C apps.

::: note
To make the most of all the features in the [Auth0.swift](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) toolkit, read the [iOS Swift Quickstart](/quickstart/native/ios-swift) first.

# Sample Projects

Each tutorial in this guide includes a link to a sample project showing the features described in the article. You can find all the samples in the [iOS Objective-C samples folder](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ios-objc-sample). 

All sample projects use a hybrid project, combining Objective-C and Swift. For more information, read the [Mix and Match](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/swift/conceptual/buildingcocoaapps/MixandMatch.html) guide from Apple. 

## Dependencies

Each tutorial uses the [Auth0.swift](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift) toolkit. It is a toolkit that lets you efficiently communicate with many of the basic [Auth0 API](/api/info) functions.
