### Add a Platform

If you have not already done so, use the CLI and Capacitor to add a supported mobile platform to your app. Use the following commands to add your desired platform(s) (e.g., `ios` or `android`):

```bash
# Add iOS
npm install @capacitor/ios
npx cap add ios

# Add Android
npm install @capacitor/android
npx cap add android
```

:::note
For more information on adding Capacitor platforms to your app and the development workflow, check out the [getting started docs](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/v2/getting-started) as well as the starter docs for [iOS](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/v2/ios) and [Android](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/v2/android).
