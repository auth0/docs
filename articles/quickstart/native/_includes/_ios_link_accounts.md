## Link the Accounts

Now, you can link the accounts. To do this, you need the following values: 
- `id`: the logged-in user's ID (see `profile.sub`)
- `idToken`: the ID Token for the saved account the user initially logged in to 
- `otherUserToken`: the ID Token for the second account received in the last login response
