This multistep quickstart guide will walk you through managing authentication in your React Native with Auth0.

## About the Sample Applications

Each step within this quickstart guide (starting with **Login**) contains a downloadable sample which demonstrates the topic being covered. Within each of these samples, you will find an appropriate application to demonstrate the features discussed in the chapter.

## Auth0 Dependencies

Each tutorial will require you to use the [react-native-auth0](https://github.com/auth0/react-native-auth0) toolkit. This toolkit enables you to communicate efficiently with many of the [Auth0 API](/api/info) functions and enables you to integrate the Login.

## Create an Application

If you haven't already done so, create a new client application in your [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings) and choose **Native**.
