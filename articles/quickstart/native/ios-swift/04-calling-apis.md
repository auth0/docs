The reason for implementing authentication, in the first place, is to protect information. In this case, your information is a resource served from a server of any sort. Auth0 provides a squad of tools to assist you with end-to-end authentication in an application. We recommend that you conform to RFC standards by sending valid authentication tokens through an authorization header.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to get a token, attach it to a request (using the authorization header), and call any API you need to authenticate with.

## Get the user's credentials

In order to make an authenticated request, you first need to obtain a token, against which your API can compare to detect whether or not the request is properly authenticated.

You should already know how to get an [Credentials](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.swift/blob/master/Auth0/Credentials.swift) instance from the [login tutorial](/quickstart/native/ios-swift/01-login). Anyway, here's a quick recap:

```swift
import Lock
```

```swift
Lock
    .classic()
    .withOptions {
        $0.oidcConformant = true
        $0.scope = "openid profile"
    }
    .onAuth { credentials in
      guard let accessToken = credentials.accessToken, let idToken = credentials.idToken else { return }
        // Good time to store the accessToken and idToken
    }
    .present(from: self)
```

In order to make authenticated requests, you can use any of the token strings inside that `Credentials` instance you just obtained; which one depends on the application usage.

## Attach the Token

Supposing you have decided to use the `accessToken` value, here is what you would do:

```swift
let token  = ... // The accessToken you stored after authentication
let url = URL(string: "your api url")!
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
// Configure your request here (method, body, etc)
request.addValue("Bearer \(token)", forHTTPHeaderField: "Authorization")
let task = URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
    // Parse the response
}
```

Notice that how you configure your authorization header should match the standards that you're using in your API; this is just an example of what it could look like.

## Send the Request

Don't forget to actually send the request you just created, by executing:

```swift
task.resume()
```

### Sample Project Configuration

When testing the sample project, make sure you configure your URL request in the `ProfileViewController.swift` file:

```swift
let url = URL(string: "your api url")!
var request = URLRequest(url: url)
// Configure your request here (method, body, etc)
```

Once you send a request and your API returns a response, its status code is going to be displayed in an alert view.

> You can use your own API to test, or, if you want, you can use [this sample server](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-angularjs2-systemjs-sample/tree/master/Server), which is quickly configurable.
