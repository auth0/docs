## Enable Multifactor Authentication In Your Account

Multifactor authentication can be enabled with the flip of a switch with Auth0. Go to the [MFA section](${manage_url}/#/multifactor) of your dashboard and flip the switch on for **Google Authenticator** under the *Choose a Provider* section.

You must specify which clients you want to enable MFA for. This can be done by editing the snippet that appears below, replacing the placeholder with your actual client IDs.

If you want to use MFA in **all** of your clients, the easiest you can do is disabling this conditional in the script:

```javascript
if (CLIENTS_WITH_MFA.indexOf(context.clientID) !== -1)
```
