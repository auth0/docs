This tutorial will show you how to integrate Lock v2 in your Android project in order to present an Embedded Login screen.

::: warning
Username/Email & Password authentication from native applications is disabled by default for new tenants as of 8 June 2017. Users are encouraged to use [universal login](/hosted-pages/login) and perform Web Authentication instead. If you still want to proceed you'll need to enable the Password Grant Type on your dashboard first. See [Application Grant Types](/applications/application-grant-types) for more information.

### Optional: Log In with Social Connections

To have a simple login mechanism through social connections, all you have to do is enable them in your account's [dashboard](${manage_url}/#/connections/social). Every social connection you switch on there, will appear in the login screen of your app.
