## Sample Projects

Each tutorial in the series includes a link to its corresponding sample project. You can find all the samples [here](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-android-sample).

## Dependencies

Each tutorial will require you to use the [Auth0.Android](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.Android) library. This is a toolkit that lets you communicate with many of the basic [Auth0 API](https://auth0.com/docs/api) functions in a neat way.

## Create an Application

If you haven't already done so, create a new application in your [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings) and choose **Native** for the Type.
