## The Auth0 Default Error Page

You can choose to display to your users the default Auth0 error page. This page can be minimally customized with the following pieces of information (all fields optional):
-	Friendly Name: a user-friendly version of your company's name;
-	Logo URL: the path to the logo you want to show to users;
-	Support Email: the email address for your Support team;
-	Support URL: the URL of your Support team's webpage.

## Customized Error Pages

If you choose to display a custom error page, you have two options:

-	You may redirect the user to a custom error page;
-	You may configure Auth0 to render a custom error page on your behalf.

### Redirecting Users to a Custom Error Page

To redirect users to a custom error page:
1. On the Account Settings page, scroll down to the Error Pages section.
2. Select the option "redirect users to your own error page."
3. Provide the URL of the error page you would like your users to see.
