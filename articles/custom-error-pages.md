# Customizing Error Pages

In the event of an authorization error, you may display to your users a customized error page, rather than the generic Auth0 error page.

If you choose to display a custom error page, you have two options:

-	You may redirect the user to a custom error page;
-	You may configure Auth0 to render a custom error page on your behalf.

## Redirecting Users to a Custom Error Page

1.	On the top right-hand side of the Auth0 Management Portal, click on your user name/icon. Choose "Account Settings" in the menu the pops open.
2.	Scroll down to the section called "Settings."
3.	Populate the following fields:
	-	Friendly Name:
	-	Logo URL:
	-	Support Email:
	-	Support URL:
4.	Scroll down past the "Settings" section to the "Error Pages" section. Select the option "redirect users to your own error page."
5.	If, in the previous step, you opted to redirect users to your own error page, please provide the Error Page URL of the page to be displayed instead of the default error page.
