# Classic Universal Login Experience

Auth0's Classic Universal Login experience is built on top of Auth0's JavaScript libraries ([Lock.js](/libraries/lock), [Auth0.js](/libraries/auth0js), MFA Widget, Password Reset). Compared to the New Universal Login experience, it offers a more complete feature set.

When you customize the HTML for Universal Login pages, the default templates will also use the same JavaScript libraries, so from a UX and functional perspective, the transition between the default user interface and a custom one is more natural.  

Given that it is being used by a significant percentage of Auth0 customers, the Classic Universal Login experience will be maintained for the foreseeable future. However, the majority of significant new feature development will be done on top of the [New Universal Login experience](/universal-login/new).
