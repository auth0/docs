# Universal Login Internationalization

## Internationalization in the New Universal Login Experience

The New Universal Login Experience is currently localized to the languages below, with more languages to be added over time:

| Code   | Language  |
|--------|-----------|
| en     | English   |
| es     | Spanish   |
| da     | Danish    |
| de     | German    |
| fi     | Finnish   |
| fr     | French    |
| ja     | Japanese  |
| nb     | Norwegian |
| nl     | Dutch     |
| pt     | Portuguese|
| sv     | Swedish   |

### Language Selection

The language to render the pages will be selected based on:

- The languages supported by Auth0, which are listed above.
- The list of languages configured in Tenant Settings, where you can select the languages your tenant supports and select a default one. By default, the list has only English, so if you want to support other languages you first need to update the list.
- The value of the `ui_locales` parameter sent to the [authorization request endpoint](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest), which can be used to constrain the language list for an application or session.
- The `Accept-Language` HTTP header sent by the browser. The pages will be rendered in this language if it is allowed by the settings above. If not, pages will be rendered in the default language.

### Using the Management API to specify tenant enabled languages

You can specify the enabled languages for the tenant using the [Update tenant settings endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Tenants/patch_settings).

```har
{
  "method": "PATCH",
  "url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/tenants/settings",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" },
    { "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer API2_ACCESS_TOKEN" }
  ],
  "postData": {
      "mimeType": "application/json",
      "text" : "{ \"enabled_locales\" : [ \"en\", \"es\"]}"
  }
}
```

### Current Limitations

- It is not possible for you to add additional languages (Although Auth0 will be adding more over time).
- It is not possible for you to override the copy for a specific piece of text.
- The `ui_locales` parameter can only be used in OAuth flows, as itâ€™s not available in SAML or WS-Federation.
- The `ui_locales` parameter is not forwarded to upstream IdPs.
- The tenant languages can only be specified using the Management API.
- It is not possible to localize the scopes in the Consent page.

## Internationalization in the Classic Universal Login Experience

In the Classic Universal Login experience, localization is done using our JavaScript widgets for [login](/libraries/lock/v11/i18n), the [password reset page](/universal-login/password-reset) and [password policies](/i18n/password-options). 

The [Guardian MFA page](/universal-login/guardian) by default uses the MFA Widget, which cannot be localized. You can create localized versions by using [guardian.js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-guardian.js).

It is not possible to localize the Consent page.
