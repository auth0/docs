# LDAP

The **Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)** is an application protocol, used for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

The function of LDAP is to enable access to an existing directory, like Active Directory.

In Auth0 we use LDAP to integrate with Active Directory/LDAP through the Active Directory/LDAP Connector that you install in your network.

For more information refer to [Active Directory/LDAP Connector](/connector).
