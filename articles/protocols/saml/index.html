    <i class="icon icon-budicon-715"></i><a href="/protocols/oauth2">OAuth 2.0</a>
    <p>
      OAuth 2.0 is a protocol that enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to resources the end-user owns. It is about resource access and sharing.
    </p>

    <i class="icon icon-budicon-715"></i><a href="/protocols/oidc">OpenID Connect</a>
    <p>
      OpenID Connect is an identity layer built on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol. It allows third-party applications to verify the identity of the end-user and to obtain basic user profile information. At the core, OIDC is concerned with user authentication.

    <i class="icon icon-budicon-715"></i><a href="/protocols/saml">SAML</a>
    <p>
      Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based framework for authentication and authorization between two entities: a Service Provider and an Identity Provider. The Service Provider agrees to trust the Identity Provider to authenticate users. The Identity Provider authenticates users and provides to Service Providers an Authentication Assertion that indicates a user has been authenticated.

    <i class="icon icon-budicon-715"></i><a href="/protocols/ws-fed">WS-Federation</a>
    <p>
      WS-Federation is part of the larger WS-Security framework and an extension to the functionality of WS-Trust. The features of WS-Federation can be used directly by SOAP clients and web services.
