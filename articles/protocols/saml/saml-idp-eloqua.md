# Configure Auth0 as Identity Provider for Oracle Eloqua

These instructions explain how to configure Auth0 to serve as an Identity Provider for [Oracle Eloqua Marketing Cloud](http://www.oracle.com/partners/en/products/applications/eloqua-marketing-cloud-service/get-started/index.html).

## Configure the Addon: SAML2 Web App

Login to [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}) and create a new [Application](${manage_url}/#/applications).

Navigate to the [Addons](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/addons) tab and enable the **SAML2 Web App** using the toggle switch.

![Application Addons](/media/articles/protocols/saml/eloqua/client-addons.png)

The *Settings* window will be displayed. Set the following values:

- **Application Callback URL**: `https://login.eloqua.com/auth/saml2/acs`

- **Settings**:

  ```text
  {
    "audience": "http://foo",
    "recipient": "https://login.eloqua.com/auth/saml2/acs",
    "mappings": {
      "user_id": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier",
      "email": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress",  
      "name": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name",
      "given_name": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname",  
      "family_name": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname",
      "upn": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/upn",
      "groups": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/claims/Group"
    },
    "nameIdentifierFormat": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress",
    "nameIdentifierProbes": [
      "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress"
    ],
    "destination": "https://login.eloqua.com/auth/saml2/acs"
  }

  ```

Note that the `audience` is set to `http://foo`. This will be changed when the Identity Provider settings are completed on the Eloqua side.

Click **Save**.

Go to the *Usage* tab and download the Identity Provider metadata. This IDP metadata will be used while setting up the configuration in Eloqua.

## Configure Oracle Eloqua

Login as Admin on Eloqua and click on *Settings > Users > Single Sign-On > Identity Provider Settings*.

Click **Upload Identity Provider from Metadata**. You should upload here the Identity Provider metadata you downloaded in the previous from the Auth0 dashboard.

Browse to find the downloaded metadata file.

Edit the newly added identity provider and complete the following steps:

- Set the **User Identity Mapping** to `Assertion contains the Email Address from the User object` and click **Save**.

- From the *Identity Provider Details* copy the **Service Provider Entity URL**.

- Within ELOQUA IDP settings, if this is the default IDP, mark this IDP as default.


## Update the Audience Restriction

We will now use the **Service Provider Entity URL** copied from within the IDP settings in Eloqua to set the `audience` restriction within Auth0.

Navigate to __Dashboard > Applications > select your application > Addons > SAML2 Web App > Settings__ and set the `audience` to the value you copied.

## Test

Login to Eloqua with Auth0 should be enabled now. You can sign in to Eloqua with both IDP initiated login and SP initiated login.

### SP Initiated Login

Navigate to [https://login.eloqua.com/auth/saml2](https://login.eloqua.com/auth/saml2) , enter your company name and start the SAML login process with Auth0.

### IdP Initiated Login

**Beginning with auth0.js v9.3.4, you must [enable the impersonation flags](/user-profile/user-impersonation#enable-impersonation) to use IdP-initiated login.**

<%= include('../../_includes/_deprecate-impersonation.md') %>

For IDP Initiated login use the **Identity Provider Login URL** defined under the **Dashboard > Applications > select your application > Addons > SAML 2 Web App > Usage**.
