# Configure Auth0 as Identity Provider for GitHub Enterprise Cloud

These instructions explain how to configure Auth0 to serve as an Identity Provider for [GitHub Enterprise Cloud](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on) (i.e. github.com). Note that GitHub requires an Enterprise-level subscription to enable using an external SAML identity provider.

When setting up SAML SSO in your organization, you can test your implementation without affecting your organization members by leaving Require SAML SSO authentication for all members of the organization name organization unchecked. See [GitHub documentation on authentication with SAML](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on) for more information.

::: note
**Heads up!** This article applies to GitHub Enterprise Cloud (github.com). If you are looking for instructions to set up Auth0 as the identity provider for GitHub Enterprise Server (private instance), check [this page](/protocols/saml/saml-apps/github-server) instead.

## Configure the Addon: SAML2 Web App

Login to [Auth0 dashboard](${manage_url}) and create a new [Application](${manage_url}/#/applications). Give it a meaningful name like "GitHub". You can choose any application type really, but the "Regular Web App" type is the more representative. 

Navigate to the [Addons](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/addons) tab and enable the **SAML2 Web App** using the toggle switch.

The *Settings* window will be displayed. Set the following values:

- **Application Callback URL**: `https://github.com/orgs/{YOUR_GITHUB_ORG_NAME}/saml/consume`

- **Settings**:

```json
{
  "audience": "https://github.com/orgs/{YOUR_GITHUB_ORG_NAME}",
  "mappings": {
    "user_id": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier",
    "email": "emails",
    "name": "full_name"
  },
  "passthroughClaimsWithNoMapping": false,
  "mapIdentities": false,
  "signatureAlgorithm": "rsa-sha256",
  "digestAlgorithm": "sha256",
  "nameIdentifierProbes": [
    "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier"
  ]
}
```

**Note**: Make sure to replace `{YOUR_GITHUB_ORG_NAME}` with the GitHub organization name that corresponds to your subscription.

The above mapping will send the `user_id` as the Name Identifier to GitHub. This is a good option if you enable more than one connection for the GitHub application, as it will ensure uniqueness (every user will have a different ID). If you are using a single connection, you might prefer to use the `nickname` or another unique identifier as a friendlier Name Identifier (but **make sure that the property you choose is indeed unique**). 

As an example, if you want `nickname` as the Name Identifier, the `mappings` section above will look like this:

```json
{
  [...]
  "mappings": {
    "nickname": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier",
    "email": "emails",
    "name": "full_name"
  },
  [...]
}
```

## Configure SAML Single Sign-On on GitHub
Follow the instruction from GitHub's [Enabling and testing SAML single sign-on for your organization](https://help.github.com/en/articles/enabling-and-testing-saml-single-sign-on-for-your-organization) to complete the configuration on GitHub Enterprise Cloud. You will need the following information:

* **Sign On URL** (for step 6): `https://${account.namespace}/samlp/{CLIENT_ID}`
  `{CLIENT_ID}` will be the `client_id` for the GitHub application you just created in Auth0.
* **Issuer** (step 7): `urn:auth0:${account.tenant}`
* **Public Certificate** (step 8): Download it from `https://${account.namespace}/pem`. Open the downloaded file with a text editor, copy the contents and paste them in the text area on GitHub.
* **Signature method** (step 9): `RSA256-SHA256`
* **Digest method** (step 9): `SHA256`

The **Sign On URL**, **Issuer** and **Certificate** information can also be found in the **Usage** tab on the SAML Web App addon settings dialog:

As recommended in GitHub's documentation, before enabling SAML SSO for your organization, click **Test SAML configuration** to ensure that the information you've entered is correct.
