# Guardian Multifactor Login Page

In the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/guardian_mfa_page), you can enable 2nd factor authentication, using Guardian Multifactor. You can customize the page that Auth0 displays to your users, allowing you to require MFA on logins which meet certain criteria, or just across the board. For more information on Guardian, refer to [Guardian MFA](/multifactor-authentication/guardian).

## Guardian Login Page HTML Editor

To enable the Guardian Login page, go to [Dashboard > Hosted Pages > Guardian Multifactor](${manage_url}/#/guardian_mfa_page) and enable the __Customize Guardian Page__ switch.

Once you do that, you'll be able to use the text editor built into the Auth0 Dashboard to change your HTML, style your page using CSS, and alter the JavaScript used to retrieve custom variables. Once you've made your changes, and make sure to click __Save__.

If you'd like to revert to an earlier design, you have two options:

* Reverting to the last saved template by clicking **Reset to Last**;
* Reverting to the default template provided by Auth0 by clicking **Reset to Default**.
