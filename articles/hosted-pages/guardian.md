If you want to change some of the options in the Change Password Widget, you may do so _right on this page_, just make your changes and make sure to remember to hit the "save" button. The options have comments to help document their uses.

The added protection of Guardian Multifactor Authentication is no small matter. It's quite customizable, allowing you to require MFA on logins which meet certain criteria, or just across the board. Take a look at our documentation on [Guardian MFA](/multifactor-authentication/guardian) for more details!
