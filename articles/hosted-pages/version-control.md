## How to Use Version Control to Manage Your Hosted Pages

You can use version control software to manage the source code of your hosted pages.
To do so, you can use the Auth0-provided extension that works with the version control system you're using:

* [GitLab Extension](/extensions/gitlab-deploy#deploy-hosted-pages)
* [GitHub Extension](/extensions/github-deploy#deploy-hosted-pages)
* [BitBucket Extension](/extensions/bitbucket-deploy#deploy-hosted-pages)
* [Visual Studio Team Services Extension](/extensions/visual-studio-team-services-deploy#deploy-hosted-pages)

While the specific documentation pages contain detailed information for the extensions, the general deploying process requires just the following steps:

1. Create a folder in your version control repository with the appropriate name (`pages`).
2. Create an HTML page (`login.html`, `password_reset.html`, `guardian_multifactor.html`, or `error_page.html`) within your folder.
3. Create a JSON file with the same name as your HTML page for each hosted page that you wish to source control. To enable the page, the JSON file needs to contain the following:

```json
{
  "enabled": true
}
```

### File Naming Example

```text
your-repo/pages/error_page.html
your-repo/pages/error_page.json
```
