# Auth0 Hosted Pages

Auth0 offers you the ability to display customized pages containing Auth0-related functionality and to which Auth0 redirects your users during the authorization process. 

You can create the following types of hosted pages:

* [Login](/hosted-pages/login): 
* [Password Reset](/hosted-pages/password-reset)
* [Guardian Multi-factor](/hosted-pages/guardian)
* [Error pages](/hosted-pages/error-pages)

While Auth0 hosts your custom pages, you can still [manage your pages using the version control system of your choice](/hosted-pages/version-control).

## Why Use Hosted Pages

Hosted pages are easy to implement and secure. For example, using Auth0 hosted pages instead of hosting them externally provides seamless CSRF protection. This helps prevent third party impersonation or the hijacking of sessions.
