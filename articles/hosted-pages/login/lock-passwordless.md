# Hosted Login with Lock Passwordless

Using Lock with Passwordless Mode in the Hosted Login Page is the recommended way to implement [passwordless authentication](/connections/passwordless) for web applications. Additionally, the Hosted Login Page is the **only** way to perform passwordless authentication with native applications at this time.

## Lock Passwordless Template

You can start out with a basic template that will provide you with a working, ready-to-use example of Lock with Passwordless Mode in the Hosted Login Page. 

In the [dashboard](${manage_url}), go to **Hosted Pages**, and then to the **Login** page section. 

At the top of the code editor for the page contents, you'll see a dropdown, titled **Default Templates**. Here you can choose from `Lock`, `Lock Passwordless`, or `Custom UI`. 

Choose `Lock Passwordless` to get started.
