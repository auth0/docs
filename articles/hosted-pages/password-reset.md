# Password Reset Page

In your [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/password_reset), you can enable your Hosted Password Reset Page by simply flipping the toggle switch.

If you want to change some of the options in the Change Password Widget, you may do so _right on this page_, just make your changes and make sure to remember to hit the "save" button. The options have comments to help document their uses.

Using this page for password resets will allow your users to maintain consistency in appearance. From the login page, users will simply be able to click the forgot password link, see this easy to use widget, and send themselves a link to begin the password reset process.
