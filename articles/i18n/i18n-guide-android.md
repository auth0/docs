## Android guide to i18n

Follow the official [Android documentation](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/localization.html) on how to localize. It will cover setting up locale resources in an Android development environment. The Auth0 key value pairs that can be localized are found [here](https://github.com/auth0/Auth0.Android/blob/master/auth0/src/main/res/values/strings.xml).
