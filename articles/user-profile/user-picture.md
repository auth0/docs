# User Picture

Auth0 [normalizes](/user-profile/normalized) common profile properties in the User Profile, this includes the `name` and `picture` field and more. The picture field is populated by either the social provider profile picture or the Gravatar image associated with the user's email address. By default all database users will have a placeholder image with their initials. When you authenticate the user, this picture field is referred by as `user.picture`.

## Change a User's Picture

The `user.picture` attribute is not directly editable. As an alternative, you can use the [User Metadata](/metadata) to store a picture attribute which you can then use in your application as desired. The `user_metadata` field can be updated by [calling the Management API v2 endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Users/patch_users_by_id) with the `id` of the specified user.

For example, if your app provides a way to upload profile pictures, once the picture is uploaded, you can set the URL to the picture in `user.user_metadata.picture`:

```har
{
  "method": "PATCH",
  "url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/users/USER_ID",
  "httpVersion": "HTTP/1.1",
  "cookies": [],
  "headers": [{
    "name": "Authorization",
    "value": "Bearer ABCD"
  }, {
    "name": "Content-Type",
    "value": "application/json"
  }],
  "queryString": [],
  "postData": {
    "mimeType": "application/json",
    "text": "{\"user_metadata\": {\"picture\": \"https://example.com/some-image.png\"}}"
  },
  "headersSize": -1,
  "bodySize": -1,
  "comment": ""
}
```

If you want to ensure that the picture from the `user_metadata` is returned in the `id_token`, you will need to create a [Rule](/rules) which will check whether the `user.user_metadata.picture` attribute is present, and if so replace the `user.picture` attribute with that value. This will ensure that the picture from the `user_metadata` is returned in the `picture` claim of the `id_token`.

Here is an example of the code you can use in your Rule:

```js
function (user, context, callback) {
  if (user.user_metadata.picture)
    user.picture = user.user_metadata.picture;
  
  callback(null, user, context);
}
```

## Change the default picture for all users

If you want to change the default picture of all users who do not have a profile picture set, you can use a rule to do this. 

Example:

```js

function (user, context, callback) {
  if (user.picture.indexOf('cdn.auth0.com') > -1) {
    const url = require('url');
    const u = url.parse(user.picture, true);
    u.query.d = 'URL_TO_YOUR_DEFAULT_PICTURE_HERE';
    delete u.search;
    user.picture = url.format(u);
  }
  callback(null, user, context);
}

```
