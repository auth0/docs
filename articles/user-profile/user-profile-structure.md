* `created_at`: the timestamp of when the user profile was first created;

* `email`: the user's email address

    * `connection`: the name of the connection used to authenticate the user;
    * `isSocial`: the `true/false` value indicating if the connection is a social one or not;
    * `provider`: the entity that is authenticating the user (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, etc.);
    * `user_id`: the user's unique identifier for this connection/provider.
