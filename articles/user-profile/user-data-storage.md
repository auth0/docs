# User Data Storage Guidance

Auth0 provides multiple places to store data used to authenticate an Application's users. This document covers best practices on how to store your data securely and efficiently. It uses a sample Application (a mobile music application) that reflects the end-to-end user experience of using Auth0 with an external database to illustrate specific topics.

The sample Application is a basic iOS app utilizing the [Auth0 iOS seed project](/quickstart/native/ios-swift). The backend uses the [Node.js API](/quickstart/backend/nodejs). For a visualization of the application's overall structure, see the [Mobile + API architecture scenario](/architecture-scenarios/application/mobile-api).

## Where should I store my authentication data?

To store user data points beyond the basic information Auth0 uses for authentication, you can use:

1. The Auth0 data store;
2. A [custom database](/connections/database/mysql).

However, if you use these additional data points for authentication purposes, we recommend using the Auth0 data store, as this allows you to manage your user data through the [Auth0 Management Dashboard](${manage_url}).

## How should I use the Auth0 data store?

Any data you store in Auth0 that's *not* already a part of the user profile should go into one of the two provided [metadata](/metadata) :

* `app_metadata`
* `user_metadata`

These fields contain JSON snippets and can be used during the Auth0 authentication process.

### App metadata

You can store data points that are read-only to the user in `app_metadata`. Three common types of data for the `app_metadata` field:

* Permissions: privileges granted to certain users allowing them rights within the Application that others do not have;
* Plan information: settings that cannot be changed by the user without confirmation from someone with the appropriate authority;
* External IDs: identifying information used to associate users with external accounts.

For a list of fields that *cannot* be stored within `app_metadata`, please see the [metadata overview page](/metadata#metadata-restrictions).

#### Example: App metadata for a mobile music application

The following data points from our mobile music application appropriate to store in `app_metadata`:

* A user's subscription plan;
* A user's right (or lack thereof) to edit featured playlists.

These two should be stored in `app_metadata` instead of `user_metadata` because they should not be directly changeable by the user.

The following section details [rules](/rules) we use to implement permissions on whether a user can edit featured playlists or not.

The first rule sends a request to our Node API, which then queries the database connected to Heroku to check how many plays the user’s playlist has. If the number is 100 or greater, we assign `playlist_editor` as a value in the `roles` array in `app_metadata`.

```js
function (user, context, callback) {
  user.app_metadata = user.app_metadata || {};
  user.app_metadata.roles = user.roles || [];

  var CLIENT_SECRET = configuration.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET;
  var CLIENT_ID = configuration.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID;

  var scope = {
    user_id: user.user_id,
    email: user.email,
    name: user.name
  };

  var options = {
    subject: user.user_id,
    expiresInMinutes: 600,
    audience: CLIENT_ID,
    issuer: 'https://example.auth0.com'
  };

  var id_token = jwt.sign(scope, CLIENT_SECRET, options);

  var auth = 'Bearer ' + id_token;

  request.get({
    url: 'https://example.com/playlists/getPlays',
    headers: {
       'Authorization': auth,
      'Content-Type': 'text/html'
    },
    timeout: 15000
  }, function(err, response, body){
    if (err)
      return callback(new Error(err));
    var plays = parseInt(body, 10);

    if (plays >= 100 && user.roles.indexOf('playlist_editor') < 0){
      user.app_metadata.roles.push('playlist_editor');
      auth0.users.updateAppMetadata(user.user_id, user.app_metadata)
        .then(function(){
          callback(null, user, context);
        })
        .catch(callback);
    }

    else if (plays < 100 && user.roles.indexOf('playlist_editor') >= 0){
      user.app_metadata.roles = [];
      auth0.users.updateAppMetadata(user.user_id, user.app_metadata)
        .then(function(){
          callback(null, user, context);
        })
        .catch(callback);
    }
    else{
      callback(null, user, context);
    }

  });

}
```

The second rule gets the `app_metadata` field and assigns the `roles` array to a field in the user object so it can be accessed without calling `app_metadata` on the application. The `scope` parameter can then specify `roles` upon the user logging in without including everything in `app_metadata` in the user object:

```js
function(user, context, callback) {
   if (user.app_metadata) {
      user.roles = user.app_metadata.roles;
   }
   user.roles = user.roles || [];
   callback(null, user, context);
}
```

After we've implemented these two rules, the app recognizes whether the user is a playlist editor or not and changes the welcome screen accordingly. If `playlist_editor` is in the `roles` array stored in the user's `app_metadata`, the user will be welcomed as an **EDITOR** after signing in:

### User metadata

The following data points from our mobile music application are appropriate to store in `user_metadata`:

* Application preferences;
* Avatar customization;
* Any details chosen by the user to alter their experience of the app upon login.

Note that, unlike the data points for `app_metadata`, the user can easily and readily change those stored in `user_metadata`.

#### Example: User metadata for a mobile music application

We can let the user change their `displayName`, which is the name the user sees upon logging in and is displayed to other users of the app.

To display the user's chosen identifier whenever they log in, we use a rule to get the `user.user_metadata` value.

```js
function(user, context, callback){
  user.user_metadata = user.user_metadata || {};
  user.user_metadata.displayName = user.user_metadata.displayName || "user";

  auth0.users.updateUserMetadata(user.user_id, user.user_metadata)
    .then(function(){
      callback(null, user, context);
    })
    .catch(function(err){
      callback(err);
    });
}
```

Here's a look at the screen the user would use to change their `displayName`:

![](/media/articles/tutorials/data-scenarios/4-settings.png)

To save the changes to the database, the application makes a call to the [Get a User](/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users_by_id) endpoint of the [Management API](/api/management/v2) to identify the appropriate user:

```har
{
	"method": "GET",
	"url": "https://YOURACCOUNT.auth0.com/api/v2/users/user_id",
	"headers": [{
		"name": "Authorization",
		"value": "Bearer YOUR_ID_TOKEN_HERE"
	}]
}
```

This is followed by a call to the [Update a User](/api/management/v2#!/Users/patch_users_by_id) endpoint to update the `user_metadata` field:

```har
{
  "method": "PATCH",
  "url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/users/user_id",
  "httpVersion": "HTTP/1.1",
  "cookies": [],
  "headers": [{
    "name": "Authorization",
    "value": "Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
  }, {
    "name": "Content-Type",
    "value": "application/json"
  }],
  "queryString": [],
  "postData": {
    "mimeType": "application/json",
    "text": "{\"user_metadata\": {\"displayName\": \"J-vald3z\"}"
  },
  "headersSize": -1,
  "bodySize": -1,
  "comment": ""
}
```

You must replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with a [Management API Access Token](/api/management/v2/tokens).

## Why shouldn't I put all my Application's data in the Auth0 data store?

Because the Auth0 data store is customized for authentication data, storing anything beyond the default user information should be done only in limited cases. Here's why:

* **Scalability**: The Auth0 data store is limited in scalability, and your Application's data may exceed the appropriate limits. By using an external database, you keep your Auth0 data store simple, while the more efficient external database contains the extra data;
* **Performance**: Your authentication data is likely accessed at lower frequencies than your other data. The Auth0 data store isn't optimized for high frequency use, so you should store data that needs to be retrieved more often elsewhere;
* **Flexibility**: Because the Auth0 data store was built to accomodate only user profiles and their associated metadata, you are limited in terms of the actions you can perform on the database. By using separate databases for your other data, you can manage your data as appropriate.

### Example

We need to associate a user's music with that user, but this information is not required for authentication. Here's how to store this information in a separate database that is integrated with the backend of our Application.

The user's unique identifier is their [user_id](/user-profile/normalized#storing-user-data). Here is a sample row from the `songs` table in our database:

| song_id   | songname           | user_id                    |
| --------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 1         | Number One Hit     | google-oauth2|xxxyyy123    |

The Node.js backend authenticates requests to the URI associated with getting the user’s personal data from the database by validating a JSON Web Token.

::: note
[Learn about token-based authentication and how to implement JWT in your Applications.](/jwt)
:::

Here is the code implementing JWT validation from the [Node.js seed project](/quickstart/backend/nodejs):

```js
var genres = require('./routes/genres');
var songs = require('./routes/songs');
var playlists = require('./routes/playlists');
var displayName = require('./routes/displayName');

var authenticate = jwt({
  secret: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET,
  audience: process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
});

app.use('/genres', authenticate, genres);
app.use('/songs', authenticate, songs);
app.use('/playlists', authenticate, playlists);
app.use('/displayName', authenticate, displayName);
```

We can add functionality to handle different data requests from our Application. For example, if we receive a `GET` request to `/secured/getFavGenre`, the API calls the `queryGenre()` function, which queries the database for and responds with the user’s favorite genre.

```swift
@IBAction func getGenre(sender: AnyObject) {
        let request = buildAPIRequest("/genres/getFav", type:"GET")
        let task = NSURLSession.sharedSession().dataTaskWithRequest(request) {[unowned self](data, response, error) in
            let genre = NSString(data: data!, encoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding)
            dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue(), {
                self.favGenre.text = "Favorite Genre:  \(genre!)"
            })
        }
        task.resume()
    }
```

::: note
The function `buildAPIRequest()` takes the path and HTTP method of the request as parameters and builds a request using the base URL of our Node.js API that's hosted on Heroku.
:::

In the Application, the `getGenre()` function makes a request to the API and changes the app's interface to display the request response to `/genres/getFav`. The backend retrieves the required data for this action using the `queryGenre()` function and returns the results to the Application:

```js
function queryGenre(user_id, res){

  db.connect(process.env.DATABASE_URL, function(err, client) {
  if (err) throw err;

  client
    .query('SELECT fav_genre as value FROM user_data WHERE user_id = $1', [user_id], function(err, result) {

      if(err) {
        return console.error('error running query', err);
      }
      res.send(result.rows[0].value);
    });
  });

};
```

## Summary

When determining where you should store specific pieces of data about your user, here are the general rules of thumb:

| Type of Data | Storage Location |
| --- | --- |
| Data that should be **read-only** to the user | `app_metadata` |
| Data that should be **editable** by the user | `user_metadata` |
| Data unrelated to user authentication | External database |
