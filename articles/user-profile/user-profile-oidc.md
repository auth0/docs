# User Profiles Returned from OIDC-Compliant Pipelines

When you're using an OIDC-conformant authentication flow, the user profile you receive in return may differ slightly from the [Auth0 Normalized User Profile](/user-profile/normalized).

The following is a [non-normative example of such a response](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-basic-1_0.html#StandardClaims):

```json
  {
   "sub": "248289761001",
   "name": "Jane Doe",
   "given_name": "Jane",
   "family_name": "Doe",
   "preferred_username": "j.doe",
   "email": "janedoe@example.com",
   "picture": "http://example.com/janedoe/me.jpg"
  }
```
