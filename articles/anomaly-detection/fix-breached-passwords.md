# Fix Breached Passwords

If you receive an email saying "Please change your password immediately," your account may have been hacked, compromised, or stolen by a third-party application that experienced a security breach. 

The breach did not happen to this account, but based on available data, your credentials may have been released by a third party. Since many people reuse passwords, we want to make sure your identity stays protected.

You should also change your password at other sites that you suspect use a shared password. Here are links for password resets on commonly used sites:
* [Google](https://www.google.com/accounts/recovery/)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/settings)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/settings/password)
