# Password Security Tips

You can't directly prevent sites from having security breaches, but there are some things you can do to help keep your accounts safe.

* **Check emails carefully** 
   + Check where an email is coming from and the links that they provide. Always do a password reset through the actual site itself, not a link within an email.
   + Often phishing emails do not include your name but something generic such as "Dear Customer."  
*  **Never enter personal or financial information in an email** 
   + Emails in general are not very secure so this is not a good way to communicate sensitive information. A trusted company/application would not ask for your information in this way. 
   + Watch out to make sure you are not entering confidential information through false links provided in emails. A secure website always starts with â€œhttps."
* **Never download files from unreliable sources**
   + Most web browsers detect suspicious sites, when you try to access a malicious site, an alert message will appear. 
   + Never download files from suspicious emails or websites.
* **Do not reuse passwords**
   + When a site has a user data breach, and you use the same credentials elsewhere, your information at those other sites can also be compromised. 
   + Use a password management tool to help you keep track of passwords.
* **Use strong passwords**
   + The longer a password is, the harder it becomes to guess. 
   + Try to make passwords long and use a mix of special characters, numbers, and upper- and lowercase-letters.
* **Keep software current**
   + Applications release patches and updates when they find security vulnerabilities in their systems. 
   + Keeping your applications, web browsers, and operating system up-to-date can help prevent security breaches.
