# Progressive Profiling

## What is Progressive Profiling?
Sometimes to create a frictionless experience you may wish your users to pass through the signup process as quickly as possible. However, you often still want to collect more data about those users. Progressive profiling is a way to do that after signup, a little at a time, making the process as unobtrusive as possible. 

## Administration
You can set up questions which will be asked to your users just after they authenticate, to be saved to the user's metadata, one at a time, on each login. You can configure related options including whether you wish to require the questions to be answered before proceeding, or validate the answers.

## Customization Options
When setting up Progressive Profiling, you will have the option to set it up within Lock, to provide a seamless process for your application that uses Lock for authentication, or to use your own authentication UI to provide the Progressive Profiling questions. If you are using it within Lock, your questions will show up, one at a time, just after the user is authenticated in Lock, in the same widget, using the same customization options that you are already using in Lock (if any). If you are using your own custom UI for user signup and login, you can set up some customization options below to streamline the process.

### Using Progressive Profiling in Lock
If you are using Progressive Profiling alongside Lock, the UI will use the same theming options as you are using with your instance of Lock. There is no need to configure any UI options in the customization panel.

### Using Progressive Profiling with Custom UI
- Using the customization options in the dashboard, you can customize the look and feel of the form that will display your questions to your user upon their login.
- When using a custom UI, the user will be redirected to the form with your custom UI; once it is answered, they will continue on to your app.
