# Open and Manage Support Tickets

With [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}), you can create tickets for questions or issues you are experiencing. You can access Support Center if you are a full administrator of an Auth0 account, or have received an invitation to Support Center from an administrator. 

If you are an existing PSaaS Appliance customer, you will need to create an Auth0 cloud-based account to log in to the Support Center. This account can also be used for Dev/Test purposes at no additional cost. Please contact your Customer Success Manager or Sales Executive to associate your cloud-based account to your existing PSaaS Appliance subscription.

## Open a new ticket

1. From [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}), click on the **Contact Support** button. If you don't see this button, then you do not have access to support (only paying and trial customers have). In this case you can use our [Community](https://community.auth0.com/) instead (click **Ask our Community**).

1.  Under **What can we help you with?** select the type of issue that best fits your case.

    * **Auth0 Service Issue** - Choose this if something isnâ€™t working correctly or you need help using a feature or getting something working.
        * With Service Issues, you will be asked to select a severity:

    When writing your description, please try to include (if applicable):
    * What were you trying to do?
    * What did you expect to happen?
    * Where did things go wrong?
    * Were there any error messages or screen shots showing the problem? If so, please include them.
