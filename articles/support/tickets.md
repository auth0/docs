# Opening and Managing Tickets in Support Center

With [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com), you can create tickets for questions or issues you are experiencing. You need to be a full administrator of an Auth0 account to access Support Center.

If you are an existing Appliance customer, you will need to create an Auth0 cloud-based account to log in to the Support Center. This account can also be used for Dev/Test purposes at no additional cost. Please contact your Customer Success Manager or Sales Executive to associate your cloud-based account to your existing Appliance subscription.
