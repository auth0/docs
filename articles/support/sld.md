# Auth0 Service Level Description

::: warning
This document summarizes the key elements of Auth0â€™s Service Level Agreement. For full details, please see the [Auth0 Service Level Agreement](https://auth0.com/legal).
:::

The average availability of the Auth0 Platform in each month will be at least 99.90%.

## Availability Credits

If Auth0 fails to meet its availability service level  during any given month and you request a service level credit, then Auth0 will provide you with a credit as described in the table below. If any credits are unutilized upon expiration of your subscription, then we will apply such credits to any other fees or expenses you owe us. If there are no such other fees or expenses, then we will pay you the credit amount.

| Auth0 Platform Availability Level | Service Level Credit |
| - | - |
| < 99.9% - >= 99.0% | 10.0% of the Monthly Subscription Fee applicable to month in which failure occurred |
| < 99.0% - >= 95.0% | 20.0% of the Monthly Subscription Fee applicable to month in which failure occurred |
| < 95% | 50.0% of the Monthly Subscription Fee applicable to month in which failure occurred |

Auth0 publishes [status](https://status.auth0.com) and [uptime](http://uptime.auth0.com) monthly reports.

If you require a higher availability commitment or a dedicated instance of Auth0 in your own IT environment, please [contact sales](https://auth0.com/?contact=true) for additional information.
