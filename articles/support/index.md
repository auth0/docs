### Community Support

Customers with Auth0's free community subscription plan can seek support through the [Auth0 Community](${auth0_community}). Response times may vary and are not guaranteed.

If you have a free account and your account has been compromised, please post in Community and reach out to us via DM on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/auth0community).

:::panel Trial Subscriptions
New Auth0 customers receive Standard Support during the 22-day trial period (customers may check on how many trial days they have left by logging into the [Dashboard](${manage_url})).

At the end of the trial period, customers who have not opted to purchase a paid subscription can use the [Auth0 Community](${auth0_community}) for assistance. They will no longer be able to access or open tickets in the [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/).
:::

### Standard Support

Customers with a paid Auth0 subscription plan receive Standard Support, which offers access to the following channels:

* Auth0 Community;
* Auth0 Support Center.

The Auth0 Support Center offers ticketed support, where support specialists are available to provide assistance.

### Enterprise Support (with or without Premier Support)

Customers with an Enterprise Subscription Plan receive extended support hours for outages, quicker response times, and access to the Customer Success Team.

## Support Channels

Auth0 offers the following support channels.

### Auth0 Community

Auth0's public [question and answer community](${auth0_community}) offers support for __all__ subscribers. All customers, even those on free tenants, can search existing through questions and post a new question if theirs hasn't been answered. There are no guaranteed response times for questions posted.

### Support Center

In addition to the Auth0 Community, paid subscribers can create a private ticket via [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}). All tenant administrators will be able to view and add comments to Support Center tickets. Support Center can be accessed by clicking on the **Get Support** link on the [dashboard](${manage_url}).

[Learn more about creating tickets with Support Center](/support/tickets)

Critical Production issues should always be reported via the [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/) for fastest response.

#### Add Support-Only Users

You can add support-only users to your Auth0 tenant. This will allow them to open, view, and comment on [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}) tickets, receive relevant notifications, and see service details.  They do not, however, have full administration access to the [Auth0 Dashboard](${manage_url}).

You can add support-only users via the Support Center. Click on your name in the top right, and click **Support Center Users**.

![](/media/articles/support/support-center-users.png)

If this is the first time you've used this feature or there are no support-only users, you'll be redirected immediately to a screen that allows you to invite users.

![](/media/articles/support/invite-users.png)

Provide the user's email address, select the Auth0 service to which they should have support access, and click **Send Invitation**. Auth0 will then send the user an email inviting them to register for and log into the Support Center.

Administrative accounts will be able to see details about support-only accounts.

## Defect Resolution Procedures

Auth0 will assign all Defects one of four response priorities, dependent upon the problems caused by the Defect. Auth0 may re-assign prioritization levels assigned by you in Auth0’s trouble ticketing system, to reflect the problem descriptions below. Auth0’s assignment will be consistent with the problem descriptions described below. Priority categories are as follows:

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="width: 15%">Severity Level</th>
      <th style="width: 85%">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>1 (Urgent)</td>
      <td><b>Emergency Issue</b>. Defect resulting in full or partial system outage or a condition that makes the Auth0 Platform unusable or unavailable in production for all of your Users.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>2 (High)</td>
      <td><b>Significant Business Impact</b>. Defect resulting in a condition where major functionality is impacted or significant performance degradation is experienced; issue is persistent and affects many Users and/or major functionality.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>3 (Normal)</td>
      <td><b>Minor Feature / Function Issue / General Question</b>. Defect results in a component of the Auth0 Platform not performing as expected or documented <b>or</b> an inquiry by your representatives regarding general technical issues/questions</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>4 (Low)</td>
      <td><b>Minor Problem / Enhancement Request</b>. Information requested on Auth0 Platform capabilities, navigation, installation, or configuration; enhancement request.</td>
    </tr>

## Upgrades

During the Subscription Term, Auth0 will provide or install Updates if and when they are made generally commercially available by Auth0 to its customers, at no additional cost to you.

## Pricing

For pricing information on Auth0's subscription plans, please see [Pricing Page](https://auth0.com/pricing) or your [Tenant Settings](${manage_url}/#/tenant/billing/subscription).

## Auth0 Status
The [Auth0 status page](https://status.auth0.com) contains information on current production status and will be updated during an outage.  After an outage, a root-cause analysis is performed and made available via the page.

Please check the [status page](https://status.auth0.com) before filing a ticket.  If the status page contains a notification about an outage, our team will already be working on restoring service as quickly as possible.  Once the issue is resolved, the status page will be updated to reflect that.  There is a button on the page to subscribe to notifications of any changes.  A root-cause analysis will be published to the status page once an investigation has been done.

## Whitehat Support Tickets

All customers, even those with free subscription plans, may report security concerns via [Auth0 Whitehat](https://auth0.com/whitehat).
