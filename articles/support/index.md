New Auth0 customers receive Standard Support during the 22-day trial period (customers may check on how many trial days they have left by logging into the [Dashboard](${manage_url})). If necessary, customers may request a one-day trial extension using the [Auth0 Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/).

## Support Channels

Auth0 offers the following support channels.

### Auth0 Community

Auth0's public [question and answer community](https://ask.auth0.com) offers support for __all__ subscribers. All customers, even those on free accounts, can use our public [discussion forum](https://ask.auth0.com) to search existing questions and receive support from our engineers if their question has not already been asked. Response times to questions may vary.

### Support Center

In addition to the Auth0 Community, paid subscribers can create a private ticket via [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}). All account administrators will be able to view and add comments to Support Center tickets. Support Center can be accessed by clicking on the **Get Support** link on the [dashboard](${manage_url}).

### Support Hours

Auth0's Business Hours are as follows:

**Standard Business Hours**
Monday, 7am - Friday, 6pm Pacific Time | 24/5 coverage during this period

**Critical Support Hours**

Every effort will be made to respond sooner than the times listed above. However, some types of problems such as development issues that require us to install software to duplicate a problem, may take time due to the research and work required.
