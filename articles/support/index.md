# Support Options

## Auth0 Status
The [Auth0 status page](https://status.auth0.com) contains information on current production status and will be updated during an outage.  After an outage, a root-cause analysis is performed and made available via the page.  There is a button on the page to subscribe to notifications of any change in production status.

## Public Forum

Auth0 offers support for __all__ subscribers. All customers, even on free accounts, can use our public [discussion forum](https://ask.auth0.com) to search existing questions and receive support from our engineers if their question has not already been asked.

## Support Center

Additionally, paid subscribers can create a private ticket via [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com). All account administrators will be able to view and add comments to Support Center tickets. Support Center can be accessed by clicking on the **Get Support** link on the [dashboard](${manage_url}).

Critical Production issues should always be reported via the [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com) for fastest response.


### Ticket Response Times

Ticket response times will vary based on your support plan (shown below).  Note that customers on non-paying trial or free subscriptions are not eligible for a support plan and should utilize the discussion forum. Non-paying customers may still raise a private ticket via the Support Center however there is no support response SLA and tickets will be answered on a best effort basis after prioritization of paying subscribers' tickets, generally resulting in a 2-5+ business day response.

Translation from former support plans to new:

- Subscriptions previously known as "Free" map to the current "Free" support classification
- Subscriptions previously known as "Gold/Silver/Home Grown" and no special support plan map to the current "Standard" support plan. 
- Support plans previously known as "Enterprise" and "Premium" support map to the current "Enterprise" support plan.
- The "Preferred" support plan is a new plan available for purchase as of October 2016.

Every effort will be made to respond sooner than the times listed above. However, some types of problems such as development issues that require us to install software to duplicate a problem, may take time due to the research and work required.

If you have specific support requirements or are interested in the __Enterprise Support__ or __Preferred Support__ option, please [contact sales](https://auth0.com/?contact=true).
