# Support Options

Auth0 offers support for __all__ subscribers. All customers, even on free accounts, can use our [discussion forum](https://ask.auth0.com) to receive support from our engineers. Additionally, paid accounts receive ticketed support via our [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com). Ticket response times will vary based on your support plan (shown below). Additionally, our enterprise support customers will be provided a support phone number.
