# Support Options

## Public Forum

Auth0 offers support for __all__ subscribers. All customers, even on free accounts, can use our public [discussion forum](https://ask.auth0.com) to receive support from our engineers and search existing questions.

## Support Center

Additionally, subscribers can create a private ticket via [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com). All account administrators will be able to view and add comments to Support Center tickets. Support Center can be accessed by clicking on the **Get Support** link on the [dashboard](${uiURL}).

If you have specific support requirements or are interested in the __Platinum Support__ option, please [contact sales](https://auth0.com/?contact=true).

Every effort will be made to respond sooner than the times listed above. However, some types of problems such as development issues that require us to install software to duplicate a problem, may take time due to the research and work required.
