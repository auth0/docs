:::panel-info Trial Subscriptions
New Auth0 customers receive Standard Support during the 22-day trial period (customers may check on how many trial days they have left by logging into the [Dashboard](${manage_url})). If necessary, customers may request a one-day trial extension using the [Auth0 Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/).

At the end of the trial period, customers who have not opted to purchase a paid subscription can use the Auth0 Community for assistance. They will no longer have access to the [Support Center](https://support.auth0.com/).

### Standard Support

Customers with a paid Auth0 subscription plan receive Standard Support, which offers access to the following channels:

* Auth0 Community;
* Auth0 Support Center.

The Auth0 Support Center offers ticketed support, where dedicated support specialists are available to provide assistance.

### Enterprise Support (with or without Preferred Support)

Customers with an Enterprise subscription plan receive extended support hours (including an option to add 24/7 availability) with quicker response times, as well as onboarding assistance.

Please contact the [Auth0 Sales Team](sales@auth0.com) if you have specific support requirements or are interested in the Enterprise Support Plan (with or without the Preferred Support option).

## Support Channels

Auth0 offers the following support channels.

## Auth0 Community

Auth0's public [question and answer community](https://ask.auth0.com) offers support for __all__ subscribers. All customers, even those on free accounts, can use our public [discussion forum](https://ask.auth0.com) to search existing questions and receive support from our engineers if their question has not already been asked. Response times to questions may vary.

## Support Center

In addition to the Auth0 Community, paid subscribers can create a private ticket via [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}). All account administrators will be able to view and add comments to Support Center tickets. Support Center can be accessed by clicking on the **Get Support** link on the [dashboard](${manage_url}).

Critical Production issues should always be reported via the [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}) for fastest response.

### Ticket Response Times

Ticket response times will vary based on your support plan (shown below).  Note that customers on non-paying trial or free subscriptions are not eligible for a support plan and should utilize the [Auth0 Community](https://ask.auth0.com).

#### Support Hours

Auth0's Business Hours are as follows:

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <td>Standard Business Hours</td>
    <td>Critical Support Hours</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Monday, 7am - Friday, 6pm Pacific Time</br> 24/5 coverage during this period</td>
    <td>Standard Support: 24/5</br> Enterprise and Preferred Support: 24/7/265</td>
  </td>
</table>

Every effort will be made to respond sooner than the times listed above. However, some types of problems such as development issues that require us to install software to duplicate a problem, may take time due to the research and work required.  Response times may also be delayed during periods of heavy ticket volume.

If you have specific support requirements or are interested in the __Enterprise Support__ or __Preferred Support__ option, please [contact sales](https://auth0.com/?contact=true).

## Pricing

For pricing information on Auth0's subscription plans, please see [Pricing Page] or your [Account Settings](${manage_url}/#/account/billing/subscription).

## Additional Support Resources

### Auth0 Status
The [Auth0 status page](https://status.auth0.com) contains information on current production status and will be updated during an outage.  After an outage, a root-cause analysis is performed and made available via the page.

Please check the [status page](https://status.auth0.com) before filing a ticket.  If the status page contains a notification about an outage, our team will already be working on restoring service as quickly as possible.  Once the issue is resolved, the status page will be updated to reflect that.  There is a button on the page to subscribe to notifications of any changes.  A root-cause analysis will be published to the status page once an investigation has been done.

### Whitehat Support Tickets

All customers, even those with free subscription plans, may report security concerns via [Auth0 Whitehat](https://auth0.com/whitehat).
