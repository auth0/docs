# How to Reset Your Auth0 Account Password

If you need to change your password or you have forgotten the password to your Auth0 account, you can use the password reset flow to set a new password.

* If you're using a social or enterprise account to log in to Auth0, you will need to reset your password with the appropriate identity provider.
* If you are an administrator trying to reset a *user's* password, see [Change Users' Passwords](/connections/database/password-change).
* If you are an administrator trying to configure the custom Password Reset page, see [Password Reset Page](/hosted-pages/password-reset).
