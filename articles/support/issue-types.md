## Issue Types

	* Normal - General support question - If you are in development and have a question about how to configure something or how to resolve an error
	* High - Production application issue - your application which is in production is experiencing a minor outage impacting some users or one feature
	* Urgent - Production application offline - critical outage impacting all users of an application in production
* **Billing, Payments, or Account Issues** - billing incorrect, going to wrong email or card, etc
* **Auth0 Service Feedback** - suggested product improvements/enhancement requests
* **Vulnerability Reports or Legal Issues** - report security vulnerabilities or legal questions
* **Other** - anything not covered above
