# Configuring and Using the Auth0 Appliance Command Line Interface

The PSaaS Appliance Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to perform operations on your PSaaS Appliance instances via authorized workstations.

## Downloading the CLI Setup Files

To download the files required to set up the CLI, please contact your Auth0 Customer Success Manager for your custom download link.

## Installing and Using the CLI

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the `a0cli-v.1.x.x` file, you will select the version that is appropriate for the operating system you are using. Auth0 provides installers for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux systems, and the installer will guide you through the installation process.

Once this process is complete, you will be able to run the `a0cli` program from your local command-line instance.

```text
Usage: a0cli [options] <command>


 Commands:

   create-key           Creates private/public keys pair on current path.
   show-key             Shows public key on current path.
   delete-key           Deletes keys pair from current path.
   update-commands      Retrieve availables commands from the specified node.

 Options:

   -h, --help           output usage information
   -V, --version        output the version number
   -t, --target <ip>    Host name or IP address of appliance instance.
   -p, --port <number>  Port number of appliance instance. Default port: 10121
```

However, if you have keys defined and you've run `update-commands`, you will see an extended list of commands:

```text
Usage: a0cli [options] <command>


  Commands:

    create-key                       Creates private/public keys pair on current path.
    show-key                         Shows public key on current path.
    delete-key                       Deletes keys pair from current path.
    update-commands                  Retrieve availables commands from the specified node.
    backup <password>                Creates a new backup.
    backup-delete                    Deletes the current sensitive backup
    backup-retrieve                  retrieves the current backup.
    backup-sensitive <password>      Creates a new backup of sensitive configuration.
    backup-sensitive-delete          Deletes the current backup
    backup-sensitive-retrieve        retrieves the current sensitive backup.
    backup-sensitive-status          Retrieves the status of the node backup.
    backup-status                    Retrieves the status of the node backup.
    nslookup <host>                  Performs an nslookup to the specified <host> from the target node.
    ping                             Sends a PING message to verify if the target node is up.
    re-ip <hosts>                    Updates the host entries for instances in the database cluster. Example a0-1:10.1.0.21,a0-2:10.1.0.22
    set-as-backup <device> [force]   Add the backup role to the target node.
    test-port <host> <port>          Verifies if the target ip can listen <port> on <host>.
    user-export <password> <fields>  Exports user to a file.
    user-export-delete               Deletes the current user-export
    user-export-retrieve             retrieves the current user-export file.
    user-export-status               Retrieves the status of the user-export.

  Options:

    -h, --help           output usage information
    -V, --version        output the version number
    -t, --target <ip>    Host name or IP address of appliance instance.
    -p, --port <number>  Port number of appliance instance. Default port: 10121

```

::: note
  Because the CLI sends commands to the server running on each PSaaS Appliance's node, please ensure that the server is both available and can accept inbound and outbound connections to port `10121`.

## Granting Access Rights to Users

Only workstations that you have authorized may perform operations on the PSaaS Appliance.

To authorize a new workstation for use with the CLI:

1. Generate a key pair by running, in your local command-line tool, `a0cli create-key`. This outputs a public key, which is now associated with that particular workstation. You will also need to copy for this key to complete the next step.

2. Navigate to the CLI page of the PSaaS Appliance configuration area, and add the key to your configuration. For additional information on how to do this, please see the [configuration instructions for PSaaS Appliance CLIs](/appliance/dashboard/cli).

::: note
Please note that any user on the workstation with access to the location where the key is stored locally will have access rights to perform operations on the PSaaS Appliance.
:::

## Updating Command Lists

To send commands to the PSaaS Appliance's node, you will need to update the command list the node accepts by running the following command:

`a0cli -t <target node> update-commands`

You may test this process by sending a `ping` message:

`a0cli -t <target node> ping`

If the test was successful, you will see the following response:

`{"message": "PONG"}`

::: note
  To get a list of available commands, run `a0cli` (omitting all parameters).
