# Configuring and Using the Auth0 Appliance Command Line Interface

The Auth0 Appliance Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to perform operations on your Appliance instances via authorized workstations.

## Downloading the CLI Setup Files

To download the files required to set up the CLI, please contact your Auth0 Customer Success Manager for your custom download link.

## Installing and Using the CLI

Once you have downloaded and unzipped the `a0cli-v.1.x.x` file, you will select the version that is appropriate for the operating system you are using. Auth0 provides installers for Windows, Macintosh, and Linux systems, and the installer will guide you through the installation process.

Once this process is complete, you will be able to run the `a0cli` program from your local command-line instance.

```text
Usage: a0cli [options] <command>


 Commands:

   create-key           Creates private/public keys pair on current path.
   show-key             Shows public key on current path.
   delete-key           Deletes keys pair from current path.
   update-commands      Retrieve availables commands from the specified node.

 Options:

   -h, --help           output usage information
   -V, --version        output the version number
   -t, --target <ip>    Host name or IP address of appliance instance.
   -p, --port <number>  Port number of appliance instance. Default port: 10121
```

> Because the CLI sends commands to the server running on each Appliance's node, please ensure that the server is both available and can accept inbound and outbound connections to port `10121`.

## Granting Access Rights to Users

Only workstations that you have authorized may perform operations on the Appliance.

To authorize a new workstation for use with the CLI:

1. Generate a key pair by running, in your local command-line tool, `a0cli create-key`. This outputs a public key, which is now associated with that particular workstation. You will also need to copy for this key to complete the next step.

2. Navigate to the CLI page of the Appliance configuration area, and add the key to your configuration. For additional information on how to do this, please see the [configuration instructions for Appliance CLIs](/appliance/dashboard/cli).

> Please note that any user on the workstation with access to the location where the key is stored locally will have access rights to perform operations on the Appliance.

## Updating Command Lists

To send commands to the appliance's node, you will need to update the command list the node accepts by running the following command:

`a0cli -t <target node> update-commands`

You may test this process by sending a `ping` message:

`a0cli -t <target node> ping`

If the test was successful, you will see the following response:

`{"message": "PONG"}`

> To get a list of available commands, run `a0cli` (omitting all parameters).
