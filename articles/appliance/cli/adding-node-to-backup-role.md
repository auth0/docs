# PSaaS Appliance: Adding a Node to the Backup Role

::: note
  This document applies beginning with PSaaS Appliance update **build 7247**.
:::

## Prerequisites

* Backup can be configured on single or multiple-node setups. In multi-node setups, the backup must be placed on a non-primary device.
* **A separate, dedicated backup device** with sufficient space to store the backups on the node that you are assigning to the `backup` role.

## Adding a Node to the Backup Role

To add a node to the `backup` role, execute the `set-as-backup` command using the PSaaS Appliance's Command-Line Interface. When issuing this command, you will need to specify the device on the target node to be used to store backups.

`$a0cli -t <node_ip> set-as-backup <backup_device> [force]`

::: note
  If you have already created a backup folder on the node, the command will fail unless you set the `force` argument to `true`.
