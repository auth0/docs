# Updating an Auth0 Cluster

Download the package provided by Auth0 to your local machine and verify its integrity by comparing the checksum provided by Auth0 with a computed one as explained [here](@@env.BASE_URL@@/checksum).

Open the dashboard and navigate to **Configuration**, then click on **Update from Package** and select the package from the file system:

Every node in the cluster will be automatically updated with no downtime.

Patches are thoroughly tested by Auth0, but we recommend that you test patches in non-production environments to verify that your applications continue to works as expected.

> Patches cannot be reverted. Taking __VM snapshots__ is an easy way of undoing any changes.
