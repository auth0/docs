# Auth0 Proxy Updater (beta)

> Note: Auth0 appliance must be version 1911 or later in order to use this feature.

The **Auth0 Proxy Updater** is designed to provide **operating system updates** to an on premises Auth0 appliance in situations where the Auth0 appliance does not have internet access.

The **Auth0 Proxy Updater** is designed to be installed on a corporate intranet in a location with outbound internet access in order to retrieve updates.  It uses the Debian/Ubuntu `apt-get` mechanism to retrieve updates in a manner that will successfully handle complex dependencies between packages being updated.  Once the Proxy Updater has retrieved the updates, the Auth0 appliance can then be configured to retrieve updates from the Proxy Updater. The apt-get mechanism used by the Proxy Updater has a mechanism for ensuring the integrity of the updates downloaded.

### Install Proxy Updater

1. [Download the Proxy Updater .ova file](https://assets.auth0.com/installers/auth0-updater.ova).  This includes a VM template.
2. Import it and prepare a virtual machine with at least 1 CPU,  2GB RAM and 6 GB storage.
3. Once the Proxy Updater is imported, start the VM.
4. Set up networking so that the Proxy Updater has outbound access to the internet for the HTTP protocol (port 80) to the following domains: 

   * archive.ubuntu.com
   * us.archive.ubuntu.com
   * security.ubuntu.com
   * ppa.launchpad.net
   * www.rabbitmq.com
   * downloads-distro.mongodb.org
   * apt.puppetlabs.com
   
   This access is needed by the Proxy Updater to retrieve updates.


5. A black-background screen with the Auth0 logo should appear.  On the left side, underneath the Auth0 logo, there are two boxes.  Verify that the proxy updater VM has internet connectivity.

6. Set up networking so that the Auth0 appliance can initiate requests to pull updates from the Proxy Updater using the HTTP protocol (port 3142).  
7. Connect Auth0 appliance to Auth0 Proxy Updater as described below.


> Note: These requests will occur over HTTP, not HTTPS.  The content received is protected from tampering via the use of keys used by the Ubuntu apt-get mechanism.

### Setup Auth0 Server

1. Go to Auth0 server Configuration section, it will have a new *Update Proxy* field:

  > Note: If you are not able to see that new field you might need to restart and make sure you are running an Auth0 appliance version greater than 1911. Please contact [Auth0 support](https://auth0.com/support) if thatâ€™s not the case.
  
2. In the _Update Proxy_ field, enter the following URL: `http://<ip-for-updater>:3142` where <ip-for-updater> is the IP address of the auth0-updater vm.

3. Press the save button.

### Update Auth0 Appliance Operating System  
1. Once the above configuration has been completed, click on the *Update System* button in the same configuration page to start a System Update on all nodes.  This process will cause the Proxy Updater to pull updates from the internet sources and then the Auth0 appliance will pull updates from the proxy updater VM.

The output from the system update will appear in the **Configuration** section in a text pane for each node.

### Updates to Auth0 Proxy Updater
Each future update to the Auth0 Proxy Updater will come in the form of a new .ova file, which would be deployed in the same fashion as the original install described above.
