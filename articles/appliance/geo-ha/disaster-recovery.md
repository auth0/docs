# Geographic High-Availability PSaaS Appliance Failure Scenarios and Testing

The following table details some of the ways in which the Geographic High-Availability PSaaS Appliance may fail and what the implications of such a failure are.

## Geographic High-Availability PSaaS Appliance Testing

To test the Geographic High-Availability PSaaS Appliance (GEO HA) failover/failback procedure, you should:

1. Take all nodes in the primary data center offline.
2. Run tests against the global load balancer to ensure that traffic gets rerouted to the secondary site.

GEO HA does not support having both the primary and secondary sites disconnected and active at the same time. Because the data layer is arranged in one stretched cluster, the cluster only permits one data node to act as primary.

The Arbiter, located in a third site, determines which site stays active in the case of severed connectivity between the two data centers, and during this period, it would continue to elect a node in the primary site to serve as the primary data node. As such, it is **not possible** to have two primary data nodes (one in the primary site and one in the secondary site) within a single cluster.

The application layer is always active on all nodes. For performance reasons, only the site containing the primary data node typically serves traffic. This is managed by the global load balancer.

## Backing Up the Geographic High-Availability PSaaS Appliance

As a customer, it is your responsibility to perform regular backups on your Geographic High-Availability PSaaS Appliance (GEO HA). Auth0 recommends a single backup, since the GEO HA is a single cluster stretched over a distance.

Typically, Auth0 recommends performing a daily backup. However, if you have concerns about a logical data corruption, or you need greater assurance of up-to-date data, you might choose to backup more frequently.

Because the backup process puts a substantial load on the backup node, please contact your Auth0 Customer Success Manager to schedule a discussion about performance impact if backups are performed more frequently/during peak usage times.
