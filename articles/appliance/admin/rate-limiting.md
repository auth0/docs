# PSaaS Appliance: Rate Limiting

Beginning with PSaaS Appliance build `6576`, rate limits for API endpoints can be enabled and configured in the Dashboard. Rate limiting in the PSaaS Appliance is done using [limitd](https://github.com/limitd/limitd#buckets).

## Enable and Configure Rate Limiting

In the PSaaS Appliance Dashboard, go to **Rate Limiting**.

Click the checkbox next to **Enable** to enable rate limiting.

By default, **Configuration of buckets** is empty, which means that limitd's default configuration will be used. Your Customer Success Engineer may advise you to adjust this value if appropriate.

Click **Save** and wait for the updates to the configuration to complete.

## Test Rate Limiting Functionality

When you've enabled rate limiting, the HTTP response includes the following headers:

* X-RateLimit-Limit: Request limit
* X-RateLimit-Remaining: Requests available for the current time frame
* X-RateLimit-Reset: Time until the rate limit resets (in UTC [epoch seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time))

To verify that rate limiting is working, you can send a call to any [rate-limited API endpoint](/policies/rate-limits#endpoints-with-rate-limits), such as the [Get All Connections endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Connections/get_connections):

```har
{
	"method": "GET",
	"url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/connections",
	"httpVersion": "HTTP/1.1",
	"cookies": [],
	"headers": [{
		"name": "Authorization",
		"value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN"
	}]
}
```

Your expected response looks something like this:

```text
