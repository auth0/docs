# Set-Up/Maintenance Recommendations for Appliance Administrators

Auth0 recommends that Appliance administrators perform the following actions as necessary:

* Restrict access to the Auth0 Dashboard/Appliance configuration areas;
* Disable sign-up;
* Schedule daily/weekly snapshots of all virtual machines;
* Monitor the [`testall` endpoint](/appliance/monitoring/testall) for every Appliance node;
* Perform health checks on the load balancer(s);
* Limit SSH access;
* Plan and execute updates to all Appliance instances;
* Configure [custom error pages](/custom-error-pages).
