# Auth0 Appliance Administration: Disabling Sign-Ups

The Appliance, when running in multi-tenancy mode, behaves just like the Auth0 cloud environment. Users will be able to sign up and create new accounts in the cluster, and this ability is *not* limited to internal users. For this reason, Auth0 suggests that you disable sign-ups for the `Initial-Connection` database connection prior to going live in your production environments.

Disabling signups will prevent users from signing up for an account in your Appliance. Therefore, if you want to [invite co-administrators](/appliance/admin/inviting-coadmins) to a specific tenant, you will need to do the following:

* create the user manually using the Dashboard;
* send the newly-created user's credentials to your co-administrator;
* invite the user to the appropriate account.
