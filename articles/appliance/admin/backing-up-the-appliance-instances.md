# PSaaS Appliance Administration: Appliance Backups

If the PSaaS Appliance is used in a stateless way (such as authentication, SSO), Auth0 recommends that you take **weekly** backups of all nodes using virtual machine snapshots.

If the PSaaS Appliance is only used to store data (such as database connections, user metadata), Auth0 recommends that you take **daily** backups of all nodes using virtual machine snapshots.
