# Auth0 Appliance Administration: Appliance Backups

If the Auth0 Appliance is used in a stateless way (e.g. authentication, SSO), Auth0 recommends that you take **weekly** backups of all nodes using virtual machine snapshots.

If the Auth0 Appliance is only used to store data (e.g. database connections, user metadata), Auth0 recommends that you take **daily** backups of all nodes using virtual machine snapshots.
