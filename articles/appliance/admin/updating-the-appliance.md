# Updating the Appliance

Auth0 requires regular updates to your Appliance instances to ensure that you always have the latest features and improvements. The update interval is typically once per month.

During the update, the Appliance instances will need limited connectivity to the Internet to download the application and operating system updates). The update will be [started via the Management Dashboard](/appliance/dashboard/updates) and typically takes between 10 to 30 minutes.

The update will be scheduled so that an Auth0 Customer Success Engineer is on the call with your operations team during the entire process.
