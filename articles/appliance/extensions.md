# Auth0 Appliance: Extensions

In most ways the usage of Extensions in the appliance is the same as in the cloud. This page explains the differences.

## How to Configure Extensions

Extensions make use webtasks, when you activate a webtask in the appliance you get an url for the webtask service. By default this url structured: webtask.<auth0applianceurl>. To be able to configure extensions, you will need to specifically add the webtask DNS to the **Allowed Origins (CORS)** section under the Client Settings.

Then you can enable the available extensions [in the dashboard](${manage_url}/#/extensions) and use them as you would in the cloud.

[See the Extensions docs](/extensions) to learn more about the extensions.

## Available Extensions in Appliance

The [Delegated Administration Dashboard](/extensions/delegated-admin) and [Auth0 Authorization](/extensions/authorization-extension) extensions are **not** available in the appliance. The other [extensions](/extensions) are available to use as you would in the cloud.
