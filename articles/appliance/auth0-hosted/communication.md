# Emails to Auth0-Hosted PSaaS Appliance Administrators

To keep you informed, we will need the email addresses for the administrators of the **Manage** and **App** tenants in both the Development and Production environments.

## Group Email Address

Auth0 will provide a daily uptime report of your PSaaS Appliance service, which is sent to an email address (with a group alias) specified by you.

In the event that there is an issue with the PSaaS Appliance, you can specify a group alias to receive alerts.

## SMTP Settings

To configure the outgoing emails, we will need the following SMTP-related values from you:

* Host name
* Port number
* Username
* Password

Please note that this information is not required until the required environments are ready. Auth0 will work with you to update your settings. See the [SMTP section](/appliance/customer-hosted/infrastructure/security#smtp) of the PSaaS Appliance infrastructure manual for additional information.
