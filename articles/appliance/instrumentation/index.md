# Private SaaS (PSaaS) Appliance: Instrumentation

The PSaaS Appliance ships with a feature called Instrumentation, which makes it easy for your PSaaS Appliance administrators or Auth0 Customer Success Engineers to gather information about the current (or previous) state of the PSaaS Appliance. With Instrumentation, you are collecting time series data about the overall PSaaS Appliance, as well as individual processes. You can then query or visualize this data to draw conclusions about the state of your PSaaS Appliance.

::: note
Please contact your Auth0 Customer Success Manager if you would like to enable Instrumentation for your PSaaS Appliance (please note that this feature is not available for PSaaS Appliances hosted by Auth0).
