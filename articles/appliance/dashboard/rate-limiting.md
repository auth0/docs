# Auth0 Appliance Dashboard: Rate Limiting

::: note
  For additional information on navigating to and using the PSaaS Appliance Dashboard, please see the section on [PSaaS Appliance Controls](/appliance/dashboard#appliance-controls).
:::

While the Auth0-managed cloud instances automatically includes rate limiting to ensure quality service, you must manually enable rate limiting if you are using Auth0 PSaaS Appliance instances.

## Settings

* **Enabled**: to enable rate limiting, check this box. Auth0 will then limit requests to services like API and logins to help mitigate malicious attacks;
* **Configuration of Buckets**: if you have enabled rate limiting, you will be presented with the various "buckets" that set the limits on calls to the API and logins. You may adjust these as necessary.
