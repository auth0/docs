# Private SaaS (PSaaS) Appliance Management Dashboard

Regardless of where you're hosting your PSaaS Appliance, you can use the Management Dashboard to configure things like your Applications, Connections, Users, and Rules.

## PSaaS Appliance Controls

There are certain settings that are managed by Auth0 when you use the cloud service or when Auth0 is managing your private deployment. As such, these controls will not be exposed to you directly, though in the latter instance, you would work with Auth0 engineers when changing settings and applying updates.

These controls, however, are exposed to you if you are managing your PSaaS Appliance instances and are logged in to what is referred to as the **root tenant authority**. If so, you will see a link in the top right corner called **Configuration**. Selecting this link brings you to the PSaaS Appliance configuration area, which contains settings and displays information about your clusters.
