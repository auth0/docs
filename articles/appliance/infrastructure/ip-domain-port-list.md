# PSaaS Appliance Infrastructure Requirements: IP/Domain and Port List

The PSaaS Appliance requires certain ports within the cluster to be open and able to access each other, as well as selected external sites.

## Between Cluster Nodes

When possible, instances within a cluster should have full connectivity to each other so that you do not need to introduce new firewall rules if Auth0 adds new features. However, since this isn't possible in every environment, the following table lists the ports that are required to be open and accessible to other PSaaS Appliance instances in the same cluster:

<table class="table">
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Port</th>
    <th>Use</th>
    <th>Required?</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>27017</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>9001</td>
    <td>Rate Limiting</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Required if rate limiting is used</td>
  </tr>

    <td>No</td>
    <td>Allows healthchecks between nodes</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

## External Connectivity

Auth0 strives to keep these IP addresses stable, though this is not a given. From time to time, Auth0 may add IP addresses or additional servers. During updates and metrics, you must allow your PSaaS Appliance instances to connect to these addresses.

## Notes

* If you are using social providers for logins, the cluster must be able to connect to the social providers' endpoints.
* The Jump Host IP is stable and provided at the time of setup.
