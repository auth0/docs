# Auth0 Appliance

The Auth0 Appliance is an Auth0 deployment that exists in

* a dedicated area of Auth0's cloud;
* your cloud;
* your own data center.

It is a managed service that is typically used if your organization's compliance or policy requirements prevent you from using a multi-tenant cloud service.

Auth0 is responsible for installation, maintenance, patching and updates. You are responsible for supplying and monitoring the infrastructure on which Auth0 runs (including, but not limited to, the VM host, storage, network resources, and other required dependencies).
