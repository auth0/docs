## Auth0 Appliance Overview

The Auth0 appliance offers an option for your organization when compliance or other policy requirements prevent you from using a multi-tenant cloud service. The Auth0 Appliance can be deployed in dedicated area of Auth0's cloud, your cloud, or your own datacenter as a managed service. As a managed service, Auth0 is responsible for installation, maintenance, patching and updates. When you choose to deploy to your own data center or cloud you supply and monitor the infrastructure Auth0 runs on. This includes the VM host, storage, network resources (e.g. load balancer, internet access, etc.), and other required dependencies (e.g. SMTP, NTP, etc.).

You can deploy appliance in several different configurations, and use several different deployment models. The configurations support different levels of scale and high availability, and are available in any of the appliance deployment options. The following table shows the configuration options:

For deployment options we support:
* A dedicated cloud environment hosted by Auth0.
* Your cloud environment using *Amazon AWS*, *Microsoft Azure*, and *Google Cloud Platform*. For other cloud environments contact us.
* On premise using *VMWare* and *Microsoft Hyper-V*. For other virtualization environments contact us.

[Auth0 Deployment Models](/deployment) provides additional details and differences between each of the appliance deployment models, and the standard multi-tenant cloud deployment.

### Maintenance and Connectivity

As a managed service the Auth0 staff performs initial setup and configuration and ongoing maintenance operations like security patching, troubleshooting, and updating. Auth0 will closely coordinate access with your operations team since all these activities will often run on your infrastructure (e.g. your network, servers, etc.). When Auth0 is managing a dedicated environment for you, we will still get your consent before applying any updates or configuration changes. The Auth0 staff does not have access to any appliances without your consent, and no information will be transferred off of the Auth0 appliances without consent from you. Depending on your teamâ€™s ability to prepare the infrastructure and its complexity, the Appliance project will typically take between 1-5 weeks.

During maintenance operations the appliance instances contact external Auth0 endpoints for updating the appliance under your consent and supervision. After maintenance completes you can block internet access. For normal maintenance Auth0 will access the management dashboard (either over a temporary SSH connection or through remote control software)to apply the update. SSH access is also needed during updates in case there are any . If you expose API endpoints used for monitoring then Auth0 will access basic operational information to proactively monitor Auth0 Appliance behavior for you.

Depending on which features are implemented, you may need to permit access to certain websites on the internet from each appliance instance. For example, if Facebook logins are needed, you must open connectivity from the Auth0 servers to `facebook.com`. If users will be logging in from the internet (and not through a VPN), authentication endpoints must be published.

The typical update cycle is once per month. You can control and which version is applied. Occasionally, lower-level actions may be performed on the nodes. You will be notified in advance on the nature of activities to be performed, and will be provided instructions on any actions you may need to execute on your side.

The diagram below details a few of these dependencies:

### Monitoring and Support

You are responsible for monitoring all the dependencies the Auth0 Service relies on within your environment (e.g. network load balancer, VM hosts, SMTP gateways, etc.). Auth0 will monitor the nodes health and notify you of any conditions that require an action if you provide access to monitoring endpoints. If Auth0 hosts the appliance for you, then we will monitor the related services.

Auth0 provides specific monitoring endpoints that you can attach to your own monitoring tools (e.g. Microsoft System Center, IBM Tivoli, HP OpenView, etc.) for audit, load balancing, performance or in cases where the transaction under test includes application specific functionality (e.g. a `rule` that integrates Auth0 with your own CRM). Detailed guidance is available at [Monitoring Auth0](/monitoring). In addition the appliance has authenticated monitoring endpoints for metrics like CPU, memory, and disk space that you query for more detailed alerting.

If the Auth0 appliance does not perform as expected, you will contact Auth0 support. Auth0 provides an incident escalation procedure during the onboarding process that explains the steps to be followed when an incident occurs. Auth0 has a 24 x 7 support staff.

### Server requirements

You will need to set up a Dev/Test non-production infrastructure as well as a production infrastructure. The number of virtual machines required to host the Auth0 Appliance depends on the expected traffic and the desired availability. In some scenarios, a single node is sufficient. For highly available a minimum of three network load balanced appliance instances are deployed for the production infrastructure and a 1 node for the dev/test non-production infrastructure. No special load balancing logic is needed (no sticky sessions).
