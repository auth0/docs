## Backup Cadence Recommendations

Auth0 recommends backing up your data on a daily basis (usually overnight to lessen impact on performance). However, if you need greater assurance of up-to-date data or have concerns about a logical data corruption, you might choose to backup more frequently. If this is the case, please contact your Auth0 Customer Success Manager to schedule a discussion, since the backup process puts a substantial load on the backup node and may impact your Production environment.

Auth0 recommends taking **weekly** Virtual Machine Snapshots.
