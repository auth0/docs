# PSaaS Appliance: Using Authenticated Testing Endpoints

For calls to the testing endpoints that return detailed information, Auth0 requires these requests to be authenticated using a key generated using the PSaaS Appliance Dashboard. This key is used in the request header of the call sent to the endpoint.

## Generating the API Key

To generate an API Key for use the authenticated testing endpoints, navigate to the [Settings](/appliance/dashboard/settings) page of your PSaaS Appliance Dashboard. There, you will find an [API Keys section](/appliance/dashboard/settings#api-keys) that allows you to generate new keys.

During the first use, you will see a that there is no key. To generate your first key, click on the "Generate" button at the far right of the row.

You will be prompted to confirm the new key generation. If confirmed, you will see that the key now populates the previously-blank field.

:::panel-warning Changing Your API Key
You may only use one key at a time. If you generate a new key, all applications and services using the old key will fail.

## Available Endpoints

The following authenticated endpoints are available for you to use:

* GET /status/cpu
* GET /status/memory
* GET /status/disk
* GET /status/services
* GET /status/network
* GET /status/internet
* GET /status/email
* GET /status/db
* GET /status/replicaset

Your call might look something like the following:

```text
curl -v http://127.0.0.1:9110/status/cpu
--user api_keys_health:YOUR_API_KEY
```

You may also make the call via https, though you will have to make the following modifications to your call:
 * Add "health" to the URL path;
 * Remove the port number from the IP address used.

For example, `http://10.1.0.248:9110/status/cpu` becomes `https://10.1.0.248/health/status/cpu`.

## Access from Outside the PSaaS Appliance

If you'd like to access these endpoints from outside the PSaaS Appliance, you can do so using your `manage` domain.

| Internal Access | External Access |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| http://10.1.0.248:9110/status/cpu **or** https://10.1.0.248/health/status/cpu |  ${manage_url}/health/status/cpu |

## Endpoint Responses

Calls to authenticated endpoints will return in one of the following status codes:

| Response Code | Response |
| ------------- | -------- |
| 204 | There are no issues with the resource. |
| 429 | Too many requests have been made to the resource. |
