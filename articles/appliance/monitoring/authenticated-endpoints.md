# Using Authenticated Testing Endpoints

For tests that provide detailed information, Auth0 requires that these requests be authenticated using a key generated in your Appliance configuration area. This key is used in the request header of the call sent to the endpoint.

### Generating the API Key

To generate an API Key for use the authenticated testing endpoints, navigate to the [Settings](/appliance/dashboard/settings) page of your Appliance configuration area. There, you will find an [API Keys section](/appliance/dashboard/settings#api-keys) that allows you to generate new keys.

During the first use, you will see a that there is no key. To generate your first key, click on the "Generate" button at the far right of the row.

You will be prompted to confirm the new key generation. If confirmed, you will see that the key now populates the previously-blank field.

 > You may only use one key at a time. If you generate a new key, all applications and services using the old key will fail.

### Available Endpoints

The following authenticated endpoints are available for you to use:

* /status/cpu
* /status/memory
* /status/disk
* /status/services
* /status/network
* /status/internet
* /status/email
* /status/db
* /status/replicaset

Your call might look something like the following:

```
curl --user
api_keys_health:S9ranHlz0qQmIs0NgcYb8hU3MLKcBB4Khth2pom5VzLryYeW -v http://10.1.0.248:9110/status/cpu
```

You may also make the call via https, though you will have to make the following modifications to your call:
 * Add "health" to the URL path;
 * Remove the port number from the IP address used.

```
curl -k --user
api_keys_health:S9ranHlz0qQmIs0NgcYb8hU3MLKcBB4Khth2pom5VzLryYeW -v https://10.1.0.248/health/status/cpu
```

### Endpoint Responses

Calls to authenticated endpoints may result in one of the following status codes:

* 204: There are no issues with the resource;
* 429: Too many requests have been made to the resource;
* 520: There is an issue with the resource.
