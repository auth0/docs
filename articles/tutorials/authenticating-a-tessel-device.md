# Authenticating & Authorizing a Tessel device with Auth0

[Tessel](https://tessel.io) is an amazing board. Not only it has a great hardware spec and a great extensibility story, you can program it in Javascript! When it was announced on Kickstarter we immediately supported it and waited long weeks to get hold of one.

It finally arrived and were able to write our first program: get a token from Auth0 and call an API.

> Tessel aims for full compatibility with Javascript. Most of core node modules also work, but not all of them. See [the docs for full details](https://github.com/tessel/docs/blob/master/compatibility.md).

## The sample

This example is straight-forward:

1. We call the `Resource Owner` endpoint on Auth0 with device credentials
2. Get a token back
3. We use the token to call an API

```
var http = require('https');
var tessel = require('tessel');

tessel.syncClock(function () {

  var device_id = 'tessel-01';
  var password = 'THE TESSEL PASSWORD';

  authenticate(device_id, password, function(e,token){

    if(e) return console.log("Error:" + e);

    getDeviceProfile(token.access_token, function(e, profile){
      console.log("Device profile:");
      console.log(profile);
    });
  });

  function getDeviceProfile(token, done){
    request('${account.namespace}',
          '/userinfo',
          'GET',
          {
          "Content-type": "application/json",
          "Authorization": "Bearer " + token
        },
        null,
        function(e,response){
          if(e) return done(e);
          done(null, JSON.parse(response));
        });
  }

  function authenticate(device_id, password, done)
  {
    request('${account.namespace}',
          '/oauth/ro',
          'POST',
          {
          "Content-type": "application/json",
        },
        JSON.stringify({
            client_id:   '${account.clientId}',
            username:    device_id,
            password:    password,
            connection:  'devices',
            grant_type:  "password",
            scope: 'openid'
          }),
          function(e,response){
            if(e) return done(e);
            done(null, JSON.parse(response));
        });
  }

  function request(host, path, method, headers, body, done){
    var options = {
      hostname: host,
      path: path,
      method: method,
      headers: headers
    };

    var req = http.request(options, function(res) {
      res.setEncoding('utf8');

      var response = "";

      res.on('data', function (chunk) {
        response += chunk;
      });

      res.on('end', function(){
        done(null, response);
        });
    });

    req.on('error', function(e) {
      done(e);
    });

    if( body ) req.write(body);
    req.end();
  }
});
```

Noteworthy highlights of the code:

1. This is 99% compatible with node (the only device specific module.is `tessel` that we only use to make sure all SSL calls happen with adequate time references.
2. The `request` function, is a simple wrapper on `http` module functions. The `request` module doesn't currently work in Tessel.

The `Resource Owner` endpoint requires credentials (e.g. username/password), so the backend user store connected to Auth0 needs to support this (like a Database connection or Active Directory).

## Tessel Setup

* Run `tessel update` to make sure you install the latest firmware with SSL support.
* You will obviously need connection to the web. You can setup WiFi with the `tessel wifi` command.

## Summary
Tessel is awesome. We see a lot of potential. This sample shows how easy it is to connect it with Auth0.

> Always send credentials (e.g. `username`/`password`) over secured networks.
