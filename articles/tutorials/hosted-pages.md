# How to Use Hosted Pages with Auth0

Auth0 provides you the ability to create beautiful hosted pages to which you can redirect to provide functionality for your users. These pages include Login, Password Reset, Guardian Multifactor, and Error pages.

## How to Customize Hosted Pages

### Login Page

In your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/login_page), you can enable your Hosted Login Page by simply flipping the toggle switch.

If you want to change some of the [configuration options](/libraries/lock/v10/customization) within Lock, you may do so _right on this page_, just make your changes and make sure to remember to hit the "save" button. 

### Password Reset Page

In your [Auth0 Dashboard](https://manage.auth0.com/#/password_reset), you can enable your Hosted Password Reset Page by simply flipping the toggle switch.

Note that by default, the current hosted Login page is using Lock 9. This will be updated to use version 10 as the default in the future.

### Error Pages


#### Generic Error Page

Throughout the authentication process, your users may encounter errors. Auth0 provides you the option of using [custom error pages](/error-pages/custom), but you may also choose instead to use the generic error page that Auth0 provides to alert the user of said errors.

By going into the Account Settings page of the Management Dashboard, you may customize your Auth0 error page with the following fields:

* **Friendly Name**: the name of your company;
* **Logo URL**: the URL to your company logo;
* **Support Email**: the email address of your company's support team;
* **Support URL**: the URL to your company's support page.

In addition to these fields, the error page returns the follow information to assist you in troubleshooting the error:

* **Client ID**: the identifier for the client;
* **Connection**: the Connection used at the time of error;
* **Language**: the language set to be used at the time of error;
* **Error**: the code corresponding to the error that occurred;
* **Error Description**: a description of the error that occurred;
* **Show Log URL**: the link to the error logs, if available;
* **Title**: the friendly name of the tenant;
* **Tenant**: the tenant information (the friendly name, logo URL, support email, and support URL fields that you may customize).


#### Custom Error Pages

In the event of an authorization error, you may choose to display to your users either the default Auth0 error page or a customized error page.

The [custom error pages](/error-pages/custom) page details how you can configure your own custom error page for use with Auth0.

## How to Use Version Control to Manage Your Hosted Pages 

It is possible to use version control software to manage the source code of the hosted pages discussed here. Auth0 provides extensions for the following tools which can be used to manage the source of your hosted pages:

* [GitLab Extension](/extensions/gitlab-deploy)
* [GitHub Extension](/extensions/github-deploy)
* [BitBucket Extension](/extensions/bitbucket-deploy)
* [Visual Studio Team Services Extension](/extensions/visual-studio-team-services-deploy)

In general, deploying hosted pages with these tools will require just a few steps:

1. Create a folder within your version control repository with the appropriate name (`pages`).
1. Create an HTML page (`login.html`, `password_reset.html`, `guardian_multifactor.html`, or `error_page.html`).
1. Create a JSON file (with the same name, but with the `.json` file extension) for each hosted page that you wish to source control. To enable the page, the JSON file would contain the following:

```json
{
  "enabled": true
}
```

**File Naming Example:**
```text
your-repo/pages/error_page.html
your-repo/pages/error_page.json
```
