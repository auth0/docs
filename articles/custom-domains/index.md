# Custom Domains

Auth0 allows you to map the domain for your tenant to a custom domain of your choosing. This allows you to maintain a consistent experience for your users by keeping them on your domain instead of redirecting or using Auth0's domain.

For example, if your Auth0 domain is **northwind.auth0.com**, you can have your users to see, use, and remain on **login.northwind.com**.

Using custom domains with universal login is the most seamless and secure experience for developers and end users. For more information, please see our docs on [universal login](/hosted-pages/login).

## Prerequisites

You'll need to register and own the domain name to which you're mapping your Auth0 domain.

## Features supporting use of custom domains

Currently, the following Auth0 features and flows support the use of custom domains:

* OAuth 2.0/OIDC-Compliant Flows (those using the [`/authorize`](/api/authentication#authorize-application) and [`/oauth/token`](/api/authentication#get-token) endpoints)
* Guardian (MFA Widget Version 1.3.3/Guardian.js Version 1.3.0 or later)
* Emails (the links included in the emails will use your custom domain)
* Database and Social connections
* Lock 11 with Cross Origin Authentication
* SAML Connections and Applications

:::warning
Features not in the list are **not supported** by Auth0 with custom domains.
:::

::: panel Token issuance
Auth0 issues tokens with the **iss** claim of whichever domain you used with the request. For example, if you used **https://northwind.auth0.com/authorize...** to obtain an Access Token, the **iss** claim of the token you receive will be **https://northwind.auth0.com/**. If you used your custom domain **https://login.northwind.com/authorize...**, the **iss** claim value will be **https://login.northwind.com/**. 

If you get an Access Token for the [Management API](/api/management/v2) using an authorization flow with your custom domain, you **must** call the Management API using the custom domain (your token will be considered invalid otherwise).

## Certificate management

Auth0 offers two certificate management options.

* **Auth0-Managed Certificates**: Auth0-managed certificates are those where Auth0 will manage the creation and renewal of the certificates for your custom domain. This is the simplest custom domains deployment option, and the scope of this document

* **Self-Managed Certificates**: [Self-managed certificates](/custom-domains/self-managed-certificates) are available for enterprise customers only. Choosing this option means that you are responsible for managing your SSL/TLS certificates and configuring a reverse proxy to handle SSL termination and forwarding requests to Auth0.

## How to configure custom domains

Setting up your custom domain using Auth0-managed certificates requires you to do the following steps:

1. Provide your domain name to Auth0
1. Verify ownership
1. Complete feature-specific setup

### Step 1: Provide your domain name to Auth0

Log in to the Dashboard and go to [Tenant Settings](${manage_url}/#/tenant). Click over to the **Custom Domains** tab.

Enter your custom domain in the provided box and select **Auth0-managed certificates**. Click **Add Domain**.

### Step 2: Verify ownership

Before you can use this domain, you'll need to verify that you own your domain. To do this, you need to add the CNAME verification record listed in the Dashboard to your domain's DNS record.

When you've done so, click **Verify** to proceed.

::: note
It may take a few minutes before Auth0 is able to verify your CNAME record, depending on your DNS settings.
:::

::: panel TL;DR;
Here's how to add the CNAME verification record to your domain's DNS record. The steps specified may vary by domain host provider, but generally speaking, you will need to:

1. Log in to your domain management service (such as GoDaddy or Google Domains)

1. Create a new record:

	* For the record type, indicate **CNAME**
	* For the **Name** field, enter your custom domain name (such as `login.northwind.com`)
	* Leave the **Time to Live (TTL)** field set to the default value
	* In the **Value** field, paste in the CNAME value provided by the Auth0 Dashboard

When done, save your record.
:::

If Auth0 was able to verify your domain name, you'll see a confirmation window. 

This means the verification process is complete and within 1 to 2 minutes, your custom domain should be ready to use.

::: warning
If you are unable to complete the verification process within three days, you'll need to start over.

### Step 3: Additional configuration steps

There may be additional steps you must complete depending on which Auth0 features you are using. See the [Additional Configuration for Custom Domains](/custom-domains/additional-configuration) document for more information.

## FAQ

1. **If I use a custom domain, will I still be able to use my ${account.namespace} domain to access Auth0?**
  
Yes, you will be able to use either the default `${account.namespace}` or your custom domain. There are however a few exceptions:

- If you are using embedded lock or an SDK, the configuration is pre-defined as using either your custom domain or the `${account.namespace}` domain, so you have to use one or the other
- If you start a session in `${account.namespace}`, and go to `custom-domain.com`, the user will have to login again

2. **What about support for other features?**
  
We are planning to support several additional features in the future, including WS-Fed applications and enterprise and Passwordless connections.

3. **How many custom domains can I use per tenant?**

Currently, each tenant on the Auth0 public cloud supports **one** custom domain.

## Troubleshooting

If you are seeing errors, refer to the following troubleshooting steps.

### Custom domain is still pending verification

If you continue to see this error in the Dashboard, make sure that the CNAME record is properly configured in your domain management service.

You can confirm the configuration of your CNAME record using:

* A tool like [Mxtoolbox](https://mxtoolbox.com/CNAMELookup.aspx) or [Google](https://dns.google.com)
* The `dig` command in your terminal

Please remember that it can take up to 48 hours for the DNS to be propagated.

### CNAME flattening

Cloudflare has a service called CNAME Flattening. During the verification process, turn off the CNAME flattening process until the domain verification steps are complete to prevent IP address confusion.

### Domains with existing CAA records

If your domain, or the parent domain, already has a **Certification Authority Authorization** (CAA) record, then you  have to add another one for `letsencrypt.org`.

The reason for that is that Auth0 uses `letsencrypt.org` to sign certificates so if it's not authorized to issue certificates for your domain, the custom domain functionality will not work for you.

To add a new CAA record and whitelist `letsencrypt.org` use the following:

```text
"0 issue \"letsencrypt.org\""
```
