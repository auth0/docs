::: warning
This functionality has been deprecated in native. After June 2017, tenants cannot use the native passwordless flow. The functionality will continue to work for tenants that currently have it enabled. If at some point the passwordless mode feature is changed or removed from service, customers who currently use it will be notified beforehand and given ample time to migrate.
