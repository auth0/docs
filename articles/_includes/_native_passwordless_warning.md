::: warning
This functionality has been deprecated in native. After June 2017, tenants cannot use the <dfn data-key="passwordless">passwordless</dfn> functions in Auth0 SDKs. The functionality will continue to work for tenants that already had it enabled at that time. Customers are encouraged to use [passwordless with Universal Login](connections/passwordless/guides/implement-passwordless/passwordless-with-universal-login) or [passwordless with /oauth/token](connections/passwordless/guides/implement-passwordless/passwordless-with-oauth-token)
