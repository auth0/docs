::: note
If you have [Refresh Token Rotation](/tokens/concepts/refresh-token-rotation) enabled, a new Refresh Token is generated with each request and issued along with the Access Token. When a Refresh Token is exchanged, the previous Refresh Token is invalidated but information about the relationship is retained by the authorization server.
