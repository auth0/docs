By default, user profile attributes provided by identity providers other than Auth0 (such as Google, Facebook, Twitter) are not directly editable because they are updated from the identity provider each time the user logs in.

To be able to edit the `name`, `nickname`, `given_name`, `family_name`, or `picture` attributes on the normalized user profile, you must [configure your connection sync with Auth0](/dashboard/guides/connections/configure-connection-sync) so that user attributes will be updated from the identity provider only on user profile creation. Root attributes will then be available to be [edited individually](/api/management/guides/users/update-root-attributes-users) or [by bulk import](/api/management/guides/users/set-root-attributes-user-import) using the Management API.
