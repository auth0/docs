### Configure Callback URLs

A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects the user after they have authenticated. The callback URL for your app must be added to the **Allowed Callback URLs** field in your <a href="${manage_url}/#/applications" target="_blank">Application Settings</a>. If this field is not set, users will be unable to log in to the application and will get an error.
