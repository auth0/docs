### Configure Callback URLs

A callback URL is a URL in your application where Auth0 redirects the user after they have authenticated.

The callback URL for your app must be whitelisted in the **Allowed Callback URLs** field in your [Application Settings](${manage_url}/#/applications). If this field is not set, users will be unable to log in to the application and will get an error.
