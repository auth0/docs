# Custom Claims

When adding custom claims to ID or Access Tokens, they must [conform to a namespaced format](/api-auth/tutorials/adoption/scope-custom-claims). This is to avoid any possible collision with standard OIDC claims.

## Example: Add custom claims

Suppose that:

* The identity provider returns a `favorite_color` claim as part of the user's profile
* We've used the Auth0 Management API to set application-specific information for this user
* We've saved the `preferred_contact` information as part of the `user_metadata`

This would be the profile stored by Auth0:

```json
{
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "email_verified": true,
  "user_id": "custom|123",
  "favorite_color": "blue",
  "user_metadata": {
    "preferred_contact": "email"
  }
}
```

In order to add these claims to the ID Token, we need to create a [rule](/rules) to:

* Customize the token
* Add these claims using namespaced format in the rule

Sample Rule:

```js
function (user, context, callback) {
  const namespace = 'https://myapp.example.com/';
  context.idToken[namespace + 'favorite_color'] = user.favorite_color;
  context.idToken[namespace + 'preferred_contact'] = user.user_metadata.preferred_contact;
  callback(null, user, context);
}
```

Any non-Auth0 HTTP or HTTPS URL can be used as a namespace identifier, and any number of namespaces can be used.

::: warning
`auth0.com`, `webtask.io` and `webtask.run` are Auth0 domains and therefore cannot be used as a namespace identifier.
:::

The namespace URL does not have to point to an actual resource, since itâ€™s only used as an identifier and will not be called by Auth0. This follows the [recommendation from the OIDC specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AdditionalClaims) stating that custom claim identifiers should be collision-resistant. While this is not required by the specification, Auth0 will always enforce namespacing, which means that any non-namespaced claims will be silently excluded from tokens.

::: note
Adding custom claims to the Access Token is very similar to the process of adding custom claims to the ID Token. However, you would use `context.accessToken` instead of `context.idToken`.
:::

Custom claims added to ID Tokens using this method allows you to obtain them when calling the `/userinfo` endpoint. However, note that rules run during the user authentication process only, not when `/userinfo` is called.
