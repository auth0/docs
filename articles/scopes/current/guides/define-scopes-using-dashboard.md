## Define scopes using the Dashboard

::: warning
By default, any user of any application can ask for any scope defined here. You can implement access policies to limit this behavior via [Rules](/rules).

You can define API scopes using the [Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/apis). Select the API you want to edit, and open up its **Scopes** tab.

Provide the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description |
| - | - |
| Name | The name of your scope |
| Description | A friendly description for your scope |

Click **Add** when you've provided the requested values.
