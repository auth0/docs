# Emails in Auth0

An Auth0 [Database Connection](/connections/database) provides several emails as a part of its authentication flow, including verification emails, welcome emails, change password emails, breached password, and blocked account emails. The **Guardian Enrollment Email** can be sent to users in any connection.

::: warning
Auth0's built-in email provider is not supported for use in a production environment, should be used for testing only, and has several restrictions.
:::

Auth0's built-in email provider has these restrictions:

* You will not be able to use any of the email customization features. The content of the emails sent for testing will be restricted to format of the existing templates.

* All emails will be sent from a predefined **from** address (`no-reply@auth0user.net`).

* You will be restricted to sending no more than **ten emails per minute**, regardless of email type.

* Your ability to send email from your tenant may be reduced (or even temporarily blocked) if your emails result in high bounce rates.

To remove these restrictions in your testing or to setup your production level emails, you have to set up your own email provider:

* [Use your own SMTP Email Provider](/email/providers)
* [Custom Email Handling](/email/custom)

After you have configured your own email service provider, the [Emails](${manage_url}/#/emails) dashboard will allow you to customize your emails beyond the existing templates. 

::: note
For users with the **Free Subscription** plan, email workflows and using the custom email provider features are available. However, a paid subscription plan is required for email customizations. See the [subscription pricing page](https://auth0.com/pricing) for more details.
