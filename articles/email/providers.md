# Use your own SMTP Email Provider

Auth0 allows you to configure your own SMTP email provider. Auth0's built-in email infrastructure should be used for testing level emails only. By using your own provider you can more completely manage, monitor and troubleshoot your email communications.

Auth0 currently supports the following providers:

* [Amazon SES](#configure-amazon-ses-for-sending-email)
* [Mandrill](#configure-mandrill-for-sending-email)
* [SendGrid](#configure-sendgrid-for-sending-email)
* [Custom SMTP](#configure-a-custom-smtp-server-for-sending-email)

## Configure Amazon SES for Sending Email

There are several steps to follow to configure Amazon SES for sending email. If you want to use the SES API, please follow this guide.

You can use two types of credentials

1. API Credentials
2. SMTP Credentials (the secret is usually 44 characters long)

For more information about SES credentials, visit [Using Credentials With Amazon SES](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-credentials.html).

### Using API Credentials

1. Sign up for an [Amazon AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/ses/) account, or login.
2. [Verify your domain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html).

3. [Request production access](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/request-production-access.html?icmpid=docs_ses_console).
4. [Get Your AWS Access Keys](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/get-aws-keys.html). Copy these keys. You will need to enter these values into Auth0 (see below).

5. [Attach a policy with the right permissions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage.html). Attach a policy with the `ses:SendRawEmail` and `ses:SendEmail` permissions, like the picture below.

## Configure a Custom SMTP Server for Sending Email

You can use your own SMTP server to send email. There are two requirements for the SMTP server:

* It must support LOGIN [authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMTP_Authentication).
* It must support [TLS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STARTTLS) 1.0 or higher.

To be able to use your own SMTP server:

1. Open the [Custom Email Provider](${uiURL}/#/emails/provider) page of the Auth0 dashboard.
2. Click on **Use my own Email Provider**.
3. Click the **SMTP** logo.
4. Enter your SMTP server `Host`, `Port`, `Username` and `Password` in the appropriate fields:

  ![](/media/articles/email/providers/enter-smtp-data.png)

5. Click **Save**.

  **NOTE:** Common ports include 25, 465, and 587. Please avoid using port 25 if you can, since many providers have limitations on this port.

  **NOTE:** You can send a test email using the **Send Test Email** button on the [Custom Email Provider](${uiURL}/#/emails/provider) page of the Auth0 dashboard. If you don't receive an email after a few minutes, please check your [dashboard logs](https://manage.auth0.com/#/logs) for any failures.

> Using SMTP makes it easy to [wire up test services](/email/testing) that will allow you to validate everything is working without spamming your real users.
