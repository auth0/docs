# Set up a Test SMTP Provider

Auth0 recommends you setup a fake SMTP server while in development or testing that you can use to check delivery and view how emails will appear without the risk of spamming your users.

You can either setup your own SMTP server, or use a services like [mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io/) that are designed for this purpose.

## Fake SMTP Services

* [mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io/)
* [debugmail.io](https://debugmail.io/)

## Frameworks & other tools 

* [FakeSMTP](https://nilhcem.github.io/FakeSMTP/)
* [Haraka](https://haraka.github.io/)

::: panel-info Note
Auth0 has only tested [mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io/) in this scenario.
