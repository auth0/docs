# Set Up a Test SMTP Provider

While working in your development or testing environment, we recommend that you use a test SMTP server so that you can:

* Check that deliveries are successful
* View how emails you sent appear to recipients prior to go live

You can either:

* Set up your own SMTP server
* Use a third-party service (see the [Resources to Consider](#resources-to-consider) section for options you might use)

Once you have either your own SMTP server set up or a test service available, you can provide its credentials the way you typically would for a [custom email provider](/email/providers#configure-a-custom-smtp-server-for-sending-email).
