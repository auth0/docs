# Setting up a Test SMTP Provider

We recommend you setup a fake SMTP server while in development or test. With this, your will be able to test delivery, and view how emails look like without the risk of spamming real users.

You can either setup your own SMTP server, or use a services like [mailtrap.io](https://mailtrap.io/) that are designed for this use case.
