# Using Rules

<%= include('./_video', { id: meta.id }) %>

In this video you will learn all about using rules in your application. Rules are functions written in JavaScript that are executed in Auth0 as part of the transaction every time a user authenticates to your application. Rules allow you to easily customize and extend Auth0's capabilities. Rules can be chained together for modular coding and can be turned on and off individually.
