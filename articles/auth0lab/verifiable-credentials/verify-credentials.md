This article will show you how to configure an Auth0 Lab tenant to act as a verifier for verifiable credentials issued by other issuers. If you get stuck, or have questions, join us on our [Discord server](https://auth0lab.com/chat).

### Prerequisites

- Install Node.js version 16.x locally. If you do not have Node installed, you can download it here [https://nodejs.org/en/download/](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Clone the [Sample App repo](https://github.com/auth0-lab/hol-verifier-auth0).
	```bash
	git clone git@github.com:auth0-lab/hol-verifier-auth0.git
	```
- Install dependencies for the **hol-verifier-auth0** project you just cloned with **npm**.
	```bash
	npm i
	```
- Have a Vaccine Credential in your IDWallet. You can obtain it following the **Obtaining a Credential** section of the [Use Credentials as a user](/auth0lab/verifiable-credentials/end-user-experience) lab.

### Auth0 Lab Environment Setup

In this section, you will configure your Auth0 Lab tenant with a new application and a verifiable credential presentation template.

#### Create an Application

Now, you will create an application within your Auth0 Lab tenant that will receive the verifiable credential API calls from your application.

1.  Navigate to the [Auth0 Lab instance](https://manage.auth0lab.com), and sign in with your Auth0 account. You will have to accept the terms if this is your first time at manage.auth0lab.com.
2.  Using the left nav go to **Applications > Applications**.
3.  Click **+ Create Application**.
4.  Pick **Regular Web Applications** and click **Create**.

	<img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/docs/auth0lab/vcs/developer-walkthrough-verifier/image8.png" />

5.  Navigate to the **Settings** tab and take note of the **Domain**, **Client ID**, **Client Secret**, as you will use them in another section.

	<img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/docs/auth0lab/vcs/developer-walkthrough-verifier/image4.png" />

#### Create a Verification Template

Here you will create a **Verification Template** that verifies credentials of the **VaccineCard** type. A **Verification Template** allows Auth0 to prompt and verify credentials matching a paritcular criteria.

1. Using the left nav go to **Credentials (LAB) > Verification**.

2. Click **+ Add Verification Template**.

	<img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/docs/auth0lab/vcs/developer-walkthrough-verifier/image6.png" />

3.  Name the template **Ask for Vaccine Card**.

4. Use the following code snippet for the **Input Descriptors** input. **Input Descriptors** are used to generate a prompt that matches a specific set of constraints to ensure the user submits a verifiable credential with the data your application needs. In this case, the example is asking for any credential where the last element of the [type](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#types) array is **"VaccineCard"**.

	```json
	[
	  {
	    "id": "VaccineCard",
	    "name": "Covid-19 Vaccine Card",
	    "purpose": "We want to check your vaccination status",
	    "constraints": {
	      "fields": [
	        {
	          "path": [
	            "$.type[(@.length-1)]"
	          ],
	          "filter": {
	            "type": "string",
	            "pattern": "VaccineCard"
	          }
	        }
	      ]
	    }
	  }
	]
	```

	::: note
	The filter parameter helps the user's wallet application find the specific credential your application is looking for from the user. In a mature Verifiable Credential ecosystem, a user could have many credentials in a single wallet. You can read more about this specification format [here](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/#input-descriptor).
	:::

5.  Click **Add Verification Template** to add the template to your Auth0 Lab tenant.

6.  Copy the **Template ID** that is displayed below the Verification Template name and take note of it, as you will use it in another section. The **Template ID** is prefixed **vp_**.

### Adding Verification to the Sample App

This section walks you through setting up Auth0 as a verifier in a web application. For this lab, we are using a Next.js application as an example.

You will add code to the sample application you cloned in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

#### Update the .env file

Edit the `.env.local` file, and set the missing values:

::: note
Sometimes “.” files are hidden by your system, and you might need to change some settings to see them or open the directory in a code editor
:::

-   `AUTH0_DOMAIN`: the **Domain** that you copied in the **Create an application** section
-   `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`: the **Client ID** of the application you created in the **Create an application** section
-   `AUTH0_SECRET`: the **Client Secret** of the application you created in the **Create an application** section
-   `TEMPLATE_ID`: the  **Template ID** from the template you created above in the **Create a Verification Template** section

For example:

<img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/docs/auth0lab/vcs/developer-walkthrough-verifier/3_change_env_file.png" />

#### App Structure

The code in its current state implements a web server with a simple UI. The UI has a button that starts the verification process.

<img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/docs/auth0lab/vcs/developer-walkthrough-verifier/image3.png"  />

The following high level steps describe how the app works:

1.  When the **Start Presentation Flow** button is clicked, the app starts a verification request by making an API call to Auth0. In this API call, the app sends the `client_id`, `client_secret` and `template_id` variables to the API. Auth0 replies with a URL and a `request_id`.

::: note
The URL is what you would normally encode into a QR code for a wallet application to scan and start the process. In this guide, we'll just display this URL as a clickable link for simplicity.
:::

2.  The `request_id` is used to call back to another Auth0 API to check if the user submitted credentials.

3.  Then, the application periodically checks Auth0 by making a separate API call to check if the user has successfully submitted a presentation. It passes the `request_id` that was received as a response in step 1, and keeps doing it (long polling) until a response indicating the process is complete is received.

To make this flow work, you will create two endpoints in our application:

-   `/api/verify/start`
-   `/api/verify/check`

When the user clicks the button to start the flow, a call needs to be made to the **/api/verify/start** endpoint, which will then start an interval timer on the UI to call the **/api/verify/check** endpoint once per second.

For simplicity, the UI is already wired up to handle calling the backend, different states, loading, error, etc. You only need to implement the two endpoints where the core logic is handled.

#### Create a Presentation Request

This endpoint starts a **Presentation Request** by making a call to the Auth0 API. The API returns a URL with the presentation request information for the user's wallet to consume.

A **Presentation Request** keeps track in Auth0 that the sample app requested a credential from a user.

1. Create a new folder named **api** in the **pages** folder.
2. Create a new folder named **verify** in the **api** folder you created in the previous step.
3. Create a new file  named **start.js** in the **pages/api/verify** folder.

3.  You will need to make API calls to Auth0. Add the following snippet to the **start.js** file. The snippet imports the **node-fetch** module, which you will use to make HTTP calls to the Auth0 API.

	```js
	import fetch from "node-fetch";
	```

4.  Assign the environment variables from the .env.local file to variables. By default, Next.js parses this file and sets the variables on the `process.env` object.

	```js
	const AUTH0_DOMAIN = process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN;
	const AUTH0_CLIENT_ID = process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID;
	const AUTH0_SECRET = process.env.AUTH0_SECRET;
	const TEMPLATE_ID = process.env.TEMPLATE_ID;

	if (!AUTH0_DOMAIN) throw new Error("AUTH0_DOMAIN not set");
	if (!AUTH0_CLIENT_ID) throw new Error("AUTH0_CLIENT_ID not set");
	if (!AUTH0_SECRET) throw new Error("AUTH0_SECRET not set");
	if (!TEMPLATE_ID) throw new Error("TEMPLATE_ID not set");
	```

5.  Add the function to handle the HTTP request. This is mostly Next.js boilerplate. The relevant part is the call to `run()` that will do the bulk of the work.

	```js
	export default async function handler(req, res) {
	  try {
	    const result = await run();
	    res.status(200).json(result);
	  } catch (err) {
	    res.status(500).send({ error: err.message });
	  }
	}
	```

6.  Define the `run()` function. It makes a POST HTTP request to the Auth0 verification API to start a Verifiable Presentation request and returns an object with three variables from the response.
	- `url`: the URL the user's wallet submits a credential presentation to
	- `request_id`: the unique identifier of the presentation request in the Auth0 tenant
	- `expires at`: timestamp when the presentation request is no longer valid

	```js
	async function run() {
	 const result = await fetch(`https://${AUTH0_DOMAIN}/vcs/presentation-request`, {
	   method: "post",
	   headers: {
	     Accept: "application/json",
	     "Content-Type": "application/json",
	   },
	   body: JSON.stringify({
	     client_id: AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
	     client_secret: AUTH0_SECRET,
	     template_id: TEMPLATE_ID,
	   }),
	 });
	 const { url, request_id, expires_at } = await result.json();

	 // the url is the "QR Code" that a wallet would scan
	 return { url, request_id, expires_at };
	}
	```

### Check the Presentation Request's status

Once a **Presentation Request** has been created, the sample verifier app needs to know if the user submitted a credential to Auth0. The app does this by calling the **/api/verify/check** endpoint periodically. This endpoint calls an Auth0 API to check the status of the request. If the presentation was successful, the API will return the JSON from the presentation.

1.  Create a new file named **check.js** in the **pages/api/verify** folder.

2.  Import the **node-fetch** library, load the environment variables. This code is identical to the previous section:

	```js
	import fetch from "node-fetch";

	const AUTH0_DOMAIN = process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN;
	const AUTH0_CLIENT_ID = process.env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID;
	const AUTH0_SECRET = process.env.AUTH0_SECRET;
	const TEMPLATE_ID = process.env.TEMPLATE_ID;

	if (!AUTH0_DOMAIN) throw new Error("AUTH0_DOMAIN not set");
	if (!AUTH0_CLIENT_ID) throw new Error("AUTH0_CLIENT_ID not set");
	if (!AUTH0_SECRET) throw new Error("AUTH0_SECRET not set");
	if (!TEMPLATE_ID) throw new Error("TEMPLATE_ID not set");
	```

3.  The HTTP handler will be very similar to the previous one. However, `request_id` must be extracted from the POST body, so the sample app can query Auth0 for the status of the **Presentation Request**. Then, pass the `request_id` to the run() function where most of the work will be done:

	```js
	export default async function handler(req, res) {
	 try {
	   const id = req.body.request_id;
	   const result = await run(id);
	   res.status(200).json(result);
	 } catch (err) {
	   res.status(500).send({ error: err.message });
	 }
	}
	```

4.  Implement the `run` function. It uses the ID of the **Presentation Request** (`request_id`) to check the status of that request in Auth0 and returns the result.

	::: note
	Once the presentation request completes, Auth0 responds to the HTTP request with an object that has a `presentation` property. The value of this property is a JSON object represented as a string. Before returning the result to the caller, we are turning the string into a JSON object.
	:::

	```js
	async function run(id) {
	  if (!id) throw new Error("request_id not found");

	  const result = await fetch(
	    `https://${AUTH0_DOMAIN}/vcs/presentation-request/${id}/status`,
	    {
	      method: "post",
	      headers: {
	        "Content-Type": "application/json",
	      },
	      body: JSON.stringify({
	        client_id: AUTH0_CLIENT_ID,
	        client_secret: AUTH0_SECRET,
	        template_id: TEMPLATE_ID,
	      }),
	    }
	  );

	  const data = await result.json();

	  if (data.presentation) {
	    data.presentation = JSON.parse(data.presentation);
	  }

	  return data;
	}
	```

### Verify it Works

That is all that is needed to implement verification through Auth0. To test the flow follow these steps.

1. In a terminal, run `npm run dev`. This should start the app on localhost:3000.

```
$ npm run dev

> hol-verifier@0.1.0 dev
> next dev

ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000
info  - Loaded env from /Users/alex/projects/auth0/vc/hol-verifier-auth0/.env.local
event - compiled client and server successfully in 423 ms (173 modules)
```

2.  Open the application at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

3.  Click **Start Presentation Flow**.
    <img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/docs/auth0lab/vcs/developer-walkthrough-verifier/image3.png" />

4.  Once ready, click **HERE**. ID Wallet will open in another tab, where you should have a **VacccineCard** credential in your wallet after following the [prerequisities](#prerequisites).

    <img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/docs/auth0lab/vcs/developer-walkthrough-verifier/image7.png"  />
    <img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/docs/auth0lab/vcs/developer-walkthrough-verifier/image10.png" style="width:40%;" />

5.  (Optional) Switch back to the tab where the sample verifier app is running. The status changed from **pending** to **initialized**, indicating that Auth0 has started the presentation flow with the wallet.

    <img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/docs/auth0lab/vcs/developer-walkthrough-verifier/image9.png" />

6.  Click **Present Credential**. You can close the tab once you see the success screen:

    <img src="https://cdn.auth0.com/docs/auth0lab/vcs/developer-walkthrough-verifier/image11.png" style="width:40%;" />


Back in the app, you will see the JSON contents of the Verifiable Presentation received from the wallet. You can explore the contents and see that there is a `credentialSubject` object that contains the data from the original credential.
