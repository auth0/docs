# Introduction

The Authentication API exposes all of the identity functionality of Auth0 as well as all of the supported identity protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth, and SAML. Generally speaking you will consume this API through one of our SDKs like Auth0.js or libraries such as the Lock widget. However, if you are building all of your authentication UI manually you will likely interact with this API directly.

This reference contains information on how to consume the Auth0 Authentication API directly or through an open source library like [Auth0.js](/docs/libraries/auth0js). It exposes all of the identity functionality of Auth0 as well as all of the supported identity protocols such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML.

Generally speaking you will not need to use this reference documentation directly particularly when you are starting out. For most people our [Quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts) or our [Architecture Scenarios](/docs/architecture-scenarios) are a better place to start.

However, if you are building all of your authentication UI manually you will likely interact with this API directly.
