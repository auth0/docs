# Introduction

This reference contains information on how to consume the Auth0 Authentication API directly or through an open source library like [Auth0.js](/docs/libraries/auth0js). Generally, you won't need to use this reference documentation directly particularlly when you are starting out. For most people our [Quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts) or our [Architecture Scenarios](/docs/architecture-scenarios) are a better place to start.

If you do want to learn to full details about the identity protocols that are supported by Auth0 or some of the more advanced functionality, this API reference is where you will find that information.
