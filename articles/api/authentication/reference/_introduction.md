# Introduction

The Authentication API exposes the identity functionality of Auth0, as well as the supported identity protocols like [OpenID Connect](/protocols/oidc), [OAuth 2.0](/protocols/oauth2), and [SAML](/protocols/saml).

Most users consume this API through our [Quickstarts](/docs/quickstarts), the [Auth0.js library](/libraries/auth0js) or the [Lock widget](/libraries/lock). However, if you are building all of your authentication UI manually you will have to interact with this API directly.

For each endpoint in this document you will find sample snippets you can use, in three available formats:
- HTTP request
- Curl command
- JavaScript: depending on the endpoint each snippet may use the [Auth0.js library](/libraries/auth0js), Node.js code or simple JavaScript
