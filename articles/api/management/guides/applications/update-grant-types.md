# Update Grant Types

This guide will show you how to change your application's grant types using Auth0's Management API. This task can also be performed [using the Dashboard](/dashboard/guides/applications/update-grant-types).

::: warning
As of 8 June 2017, new Auth0 customers **cannot** add legacy grant types to their Applications. Customers as of 8 June 2017 can add legacy grant types to only their existing Applications.
:::

::: warning
Attempting to use a flow with an Application lacking the appropriate `grant_types` for that flow (or with the field empty) will result in the following error:

```text
Grant type `grant_type` not allowed for the client.
```
:::

1. Make a `PATCH` call to the [Update a Client endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Clients/patch_clients_by_id). Be sure to replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID`, `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and `GRANT_TYPE` placeholder values with your client ID, Management API Access Token, and desired grant type, respectively.

```har
{
	"method": "PATCH",
	"url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/clients/YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
	"headers": [
    	{ "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" },
   		{ "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" },
    	{ "name": "Cache-Control", "value": "no-cache" }
	],
	"postData": {
      	"mimeType": "application/json",
      	"text" : "{ \"grant_types\": \"GRANT_TYPES\" }"
	}
}
```

| Value | Description |
| - | - |
| `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` | Î¤he ID of the application to be updated. |
| `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` | [Access Tokens for the Management API](/api/management/v2/tokens) with the scope `update:clients`. |
| `GRANT_TYPES` | The grant types you would like to enable for the specified application. |
