# View Role Groups

This guide will show you how to view the groups to which a specific role has been assigned using Auth0's Management API. This task can also be performed [using the Dashboard](/dashboard/guides/roles/view-role-groups). Groups and roles are used with the API Authorization Core feature set.

<%= include('../../../../authorization/_includes/_enable-authz-core') %>

1. Make a `GET` call to the [Get Role Groups endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/roles/get_role_groups). Be sure to replace `ROLE_ID` and `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` placeholder values with your role ID and Management API Access Token, respectively.

```har
{
	"method": "GET",
	"url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/roles/ROLE_ID/groups",
	"headers": [
   	{ "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" }
	]
}
```

| **Value** | **Description** |
| - | - |
| `ROLE_ID` | Î¤he ID of the role for which you want to get groups. |
| `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` | [Access Token for the Management API](/api/management/v2/tokens) with the scopes `read:groups` and `read:roles`. |
