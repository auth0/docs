# View Group Users

This guide will show you how to view the users assigned to a group using Auth0's Management API. This task can also be performed [using the Dashboard](/dashboard/guides/groups/view-group-users). Groups are used with the API Authorization Core feature set.

<%= include('../../../../authorization/_includes/_enable-authz-core') %>

1. Make a `GET` call to the [Get Group Users endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/groups/get_group_users). Be sure to replace GROUP_ID` and `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` placeholder values with your group ID and Management API Access Token, respectively.

```har
{
	"method": "GET",
	"url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/groups/GROUP_ID/users",
	"headers": [
   	{ "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" }
	]
}
```

| **Value** | **Description** |
| - | - |
| `GROUP_ID` | Î¤he ID of the group for which you want to get users. |
| `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` | [Access Token for the Management API](/api/management/v2/tokens) with the scopes `read:users` and `read:groups`. |
