# Promote Connection to Domain Level

This guide will show you how to promote connections to domain level using Auth0's Management API. 

1. Make a `PATCH` call to the [Update a Connection endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Connections/patch_connections_by_id). Be sure to replace `CONNECTION_ID` and `MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN` placeholder values with your connection ID and Management API Access Token, respectively.

```har
{
  "method": "PATCH",
  "url": "https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/connections/CONNECTION_ID",
  "headers": [
    { "name": "Content-Type", "value": "application/json" },
    { "name": "Authorization", "value": "Bearer MGMT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN" },
    { "name": "Cache-Control", "value": "no-cache" }
  ],
  "postData": {
      "mimeType": "application/json",
      "text" : "{ \"is_domain_connection\": true }"
  }
}
```
