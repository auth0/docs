# Get Access Tokens for Testing

::: warning
This method for obtaining Access Tokens is **only for test purposes**. Do not get manually long-lived tokens and use them in your applications, because that nullifies the security advantages that tokens offer. 
:::

## Prerequisite

* [Create and Authorize a Machine-to-Machine Application](/api/management/v2/create-m2m-app). 

## Get Access Tokens Manually

1. Go to [the API Explorer tab of your Auth0 Management API](${manage_url}/#/apis/management/explorer). 
A token is automatically generated and displayed there. 

2. Click __Copy Token__. 
You can now make authorized calls to the [Management API](/api/management/v2) using this token.

3. Set expiration time.
This token has, by default, an expiration time of __24 hours__ (86400 seconds). After that period, the token expires and you will need to get a new one. To change the expiration time, update the __Token Expiration (Seconds)__ field and click __Update & Regenerate Token__.

:::warning
These tokens **cannot be revoked** so long expiration times are not recommended. Instead we recommend that you use short expiration times and issue a new one every time you need it.
:::

## Use Access Tokens for Testing

To use the Access Token you just created for testing purposes, use the [Management API v2 explorer page](/api/management/v2) to manually call an endpoint with the token.

1. Go to the [Management API v2 explorer page](/api/management/v2#!).
1. Click the __Set API Token__ button at the top left.
1. Set the __API Token__ field, and click __Set Token__.
1. Under the __Set API Token__ button at the top left, some new information is now displayed: the domain and token set, and the scopes that have been granted to this application.
1. Go to the endpoint you want to call, fill any parameters that might be required and click __Try__.
