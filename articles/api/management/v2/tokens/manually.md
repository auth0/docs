# Manually Generate and Use an Access Token for the Management API

If you need to make a call to the Management API for quick/one-off actions, you can obtain an Access Token manually via the Dashboard.

To generate a token for use with the Management API, you will need to:

1. Create and authorize a client
2. Get the token by copying it for later use

## 1. Create and authorize a client

::: warning
You need to follow the steps to create and authorize a client only once.
:::

The first thing you need to do is create an authorize a Machine to Machine Application.

We recommend creating a Machine to Machine Application exclusively for authorizing access to the Management API instead of reusing one you might already have.

::: panel What is a Machine to Machine Application?
A Machine to Machine Application represents a program that interacts with an API where there is no user involved. For example, you might have a server-side script that needs access to an API, which is a [machine to machine interaction](/api-auth/grant/client-credentials). In such instances, you must use a Machine to Machine Application (instead of a Single Page or Native App client), since neither meet the security requirements for this type of flow.
:::

To create and authorize a Machine to Machine Application for the Management API, go to [the API Explorer tab of your Auth0 Management API](${manage_url}/#/apis/management/explorer).

Click the button __Create & Authorize a Test Client__.

That's it! A new client has been created for you, and it is authorized to access the Management API.

### Scopes

Please note that each Machine to Machine Application that accesses an API has to be granted a set of scopes. The client that we just created has been granted **all** scopes needed to call the Management API endpoints -- in other words, token users can access all endpoints.

::: panel What are scopes?
Scopes are permissions granted by the owner. Each [Auth0 Management API v2](/api/management/v2) endpoint requires specific scopes.

For example, the [Get all clients](/api/management/v2#!/Clients/get_clients) endpoint requires the read:clients and read:client_keys scopes, while the [Create a client](/api/management/v2#!/Clients/post_clients) endpoint requires the `create:clients` scope.

If you need to read **and** create clients, then your token should include three scopes: read:clients, read:client_keys, and create:clients.
:::

::: note
If you have multiple apps needing access to the Management API, and each app needs a different set of scopes, we recommend creating a Machine to Machine Application for each app.
:::

### How to Set Scopes

To set the scopes for the Machine to Machine Applications that access the Management API:

1. Launch the [Auth0 Management API](${manage_url}/#/apis)
2. Open the **Machine to Machine Applications** tab
3. Find the client you're interested in configuring, and click the drop-down arrow located to the right of its name
4. Select the scopes desired

## 2. Get the token

The Access Token is automatically generated and displayed on [the API Explorer tab of your Auth0 Management API](${manage_url}/#/apis/management/explorer).

Please note that this token has, by default, an expiration time of **24 hours** (86400 seconds). To change this, you can update the __Token Expiration (Seconds)__ field before clicking __Update & Regenerate Token__.

Finally, click __Copy Token__ to get the updated token so that you can make authorized calls to the [Management API](/api/management/v2).

## 3. Use the token

You can use the [Management API Explorer](/api/management/v2) to manually call an endpoint.

You will need:

* The Access Token you just obtained
* The domain for your tenant (**${account.namespace}**). You can also find this on the **Settings** page for any of your [clients](${manage_url}/#/clients/${account.clientId}/settings)

Once you have this information you are ready to call the API. Follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Management API Explorer](/api/management/v2)
1. Click the __Set API Token__ button at the top left of your screen
1. Set the __Domain__ and __API Token__ fields, and click __Set Token__
1. You will now see the following information displayed under __Set API Token__: the domain, the token set, and the scopes that have been granted
1. Go to the endpoint you want to call, fill any parameters that might be required, and click __Try__
