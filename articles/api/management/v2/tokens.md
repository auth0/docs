# Access Tokens for the Management API

To call the [Auth0 Management API v2](/api/management/v2) endpoints, you need to authenticate with a token called the __Auth0 Management API Token__. This token is a [JSON Web Token](/jwt) and it contains specific granted permissions (known as __scopes__).

To call an endpoint for test purposes, you can get a token manually using the Dashboard. For production however, the recommended best practice is to get short-lived tokens programmatically. 

To call endpoints, you will need to do the following:

* [Create and Authorize a Machine-to-Machine Application](/api/management/v2/create-m2m-app)
* [Get Access Tokens for Testing](/api/management/v2/get-access-tokens-for-test)
* [Get Access Tokens for Production](/api/management/v2/get-access-tokens-for-production)

::: note
For single page applications (SPAs), you will need to [get an Access Token from the frontend](/api/management/v2/get-access-tokens-for-spas).
