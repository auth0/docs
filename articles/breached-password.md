# Breached Password Security

## What happened that I received an email saying "Please change your password immediately"?

Your account could have possibly been hacked, compromised or stolen by a third party application that experienced a security breach. This breach did not happen to this account, but based on available data, your credentials may have been released. Since many people reuse passwords, we wanted to make sure you stay protected.

You may also want to change your password at any other sites that you suspect you used a shared password. 
Here are links for password resets on commonly used sites:
* [Google](https://www.google.com/accounts/recovery/)
* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/settings)
* [Twitter](https://twitter.com/settings/password)

## General Security Tips

You can't prevent certain sites from security breaches, but there are some things you can do to help keep your accounts safe.

* **Check your emails carefully** 
Make sure to check where an email is coming from, and the links that they provide. Often phishing emails do not include your name but something generic such as "Dear Customer".  Always do a password reset through the actual site itself.
*  **Never enter personal or financial information in an email** 
Emails in general are not very secure, so this is not a good way to communicate sensitive information. A trusted company/application would not ask for your information in this way. Also watch out to make sure you are not entering confidential information through false the links provided in emails. A secure website always starts with “https”.
* **Never download files from unreliable sources**
Most web browsers detect suspicious sites, when you try to access a malicious site, an alert message will appear. Never download files from suspicious emails or websites.
* **Do not reuse passwords**
When one site has a breach of user data, if you use the same credentials elsewhere, your information in other sites can also be accessed. There are many password tools out there to help you keep track of passwords.
* **Use strong passwords**
The longer a password is, the harder it becomes to guess. Try to make passwords long and use a mix of special characters, numbers and upper and lowercase letters.
* **Keep software current**
Applications release patches and updates when they find security vulnerabilities in their systems. Keeping your applications, web browsers and operating system up to date can help prevent security breaches.
