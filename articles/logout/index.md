# Logout

When you're implementing the logout functionality for your app, there are typically three sessions layers you need to consider:

- __Application Session__: The first is the session inside your application. Though your application uses Auth0 to authenticate users, you'll still need to track that the user has logged in to your application. In a regular web application, this is achieved by storing information inside a cookie. You need to log out the user from your application by clearing their session.

- __Auth0 session__: Auth0 also keep a session for the user and stores their information inside a cookie. The next time a user is redirected to the Auth0 Lock screen, the user's information will be remembered. To log out a user from Auth0, you need to clear the single sign-on (SSO) cookie.

- __Identity Provider session__: The last layer is the Identity Provider, such as Facebook or Google. When users attempt to sign in with any of these providers and they are already signed into the provider, they will not be prompted again to sign in. They may simply be asked to give permissions to share their information with Auth0 and in turn, your application.

This document explains how to log out a user from the Auth0 session and (optionally) from the Identity Provider session. Remember that you should handle the Application Session in your app!

## Log Out a User

The [logout endpoint](/api/authentication?javascript#logout) in Auth0 works in one of two ways:

- Clear the SSO cookie in Auth0
- Clear the SSO cookie in Auth0 and sign out the user from the IdP (such as ADFS or Google)

To force a logout, redirect the user to the following URL:

```text
https://${account.namespace}/v2/logout
```

Redirecting the user to this URL clears all single sign-on cookies set by Auth0 for the user.

Although this is not common practice, you can also force the user to log out of their identity provider. To do this, add a `federated` querystring parameter to the logout URL:

```text
https://${account.namespace}/v2/logout?federated
```

The following identity providers support federated logout:

* AOL
* Evernote
* Facebook
* Fitbit
* GitHub
* Google
  * Apps
  * OAuth 2.0
* LinkedIn
* Microsoft
  * Active Directory Federation Services
  * Office 365
  * Windows Azure Active Directory
  * Windows Live
* Salesforce/Salesforce Sandbox
* Twitter
* Yahoo
* Yammer

::: panel-warning Clear your application session
The Auth0 [logout endpoint](/api/authentication?javascript#logout) logs you out from Auth0, and (optionally) from your identity provider. It does *not* log you out of your application! This is something that you must implement on your side. You need to log out the user from your application by clearing their session. You might find [this video](/videos/session-and-cookies) helpful.

## Redirect Users After Logout

To redirect a user after logout, add a `returnTo` querystring parameter with the target URL as the value. We suggest that you encode the target URL being passed in -- for example, to redirect the user to `http://www.example.com` after logout, you can make the following request:

```text
https://${account.namespace}/v2/logout?returnTo=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com
```

You will need to add the non-encoded `returnTo` URL (for these examples, it is `http://www.example.com`) as an **Allowed Logout URLs** in one of two places:

* For logout requests that do not include the `client_id` parameter, such as:

    ```text
    https://${account.namespace}/v2/logout?returnTo=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com
    ```

  you must add the `returnTo` URL (for example `http://www.example.com`) to the **Allowed Logout URLs** list in the [Advanced tab of your Tenant Settings](${manage_url}/#/tenant/advanced). See [Set the Allowed Logout URLs at the Tenant Level](#set-the-allowed-logout-urls-at-the-tenant-level) for more information.

* For logout requests that include the `client_id` parameter, such as:

    ```text
    https://${account.namespace}/v2/logout?returnTo=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com&client_id=CLIENT_ID
    ```

  you must add the `returnTo` URL (for example `http://www.example.com`) to the **Allowed Logout URLs** list in the **Settings** tab of your Auth0 app that is associated with the specified `CLIENT_ID`. See [Set the Allowed Logout URLs at the Application Level](#set-the-allowed-logout-urls-at-the-application-level) for more information.

### Set the Allowed Logout URLs at the Tenant Level

To add a list of URLs that the user may be redirected to after logging out at the tenant level, go to the [Tenant Settings > Advanced](${manage_url}/#/tenant/advanced) of the Auth0 Dashboard.

When providing the URL list, you can:

* Specify multiple, valid, comma-separated URLs
* Use `*` as a wildcard for subdomains (such as `http://*.example.com`)

### Set the Allowed Logout URLs at the Application Level

To redirect the user after they log out from a specific application, you must add the URL used in the `returnTo` parameter of the redirect URL to the **Allowed Logout URLs** list in the **Settings** tab of your Auth0 application that is associated with the `CLIENT_ID` parameter.

![Application level logout screen](/media/articles/logout/client-level-logout.png)

When providing the URL list, you can:

* Specify multiple, valid, comma-separated URLs
* Use `*` as a wildcard for subdomains (such as `http://*.example.com`)

::: note
In order to avoid validation errors, make sure that you include the protocol part of the URL. For example, setting the value to `*.example.com` will result in a validation error, so you should use `http://*.example.com` instead.
:::

#### Limitations

* The validation of URLs provided as values to the `returnTo` parameter, the querystring, and hash information provided as part of the URL are not taken into account.

* The `returnTo` parameter does not work with all social providers. Please check your social provider's settings to ensure that they will accept the `redirectTo` parameter.

* The URLs provided to the **Allowed Logout URLs** list are case-sensitive, so the URL used for logouts must match the case of the logout URL configured on the dashboard. Note, that the scheme and host parts, however, are case insensitive. For example, if your URL is `http://www.Example.Com/FooHoo.html`, the `http://www.Example.Com` portion is case insensitive, while the `FooHoo.html` portion is case sensitive.

::: note
If you are working with social identity providers such as Google or Facebook, you must set your `Client ID` and `Secret` for these providers in the [Dashboard](${manage_url}) for the logout to function properly.
:::

#### Facebook Users

If you are using Facebook, please be aware of the additional requirements when triggering a logout.

You will also need to encode the `returnTo` parameter.

```text
https://${account.namespace}/v2/logout?federated&
      returnTo=https%3A%2F%2F${account.namespace}%2Flogout%3FreturnTo%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com
      &access_token=[facebook access_token]
```

## SAML Logout

SAML logout is configured differently depending on whether Auth0 acts as the Service Provider (i.e. when you create a SAML **connection**) or when Auth0 acts as the Identity Provider (i.e. when you have an application with the SAML2 Web App addon).

### Logout for Auth0 as SAML Service Provider

To logout users from an external SAML identity provider, you must configure a [SAML logout URL](/saml-sp-generic#1-obtain-information-from-idp) in the SAML connection settings. If you don't configure a logout URL, Auth0 will use the __SAML login URL__.

Auth0 will initiate a logout by sending a SAML logout request to the external identity provider if the `federated` query string parameter is included when redirecting the user to the [logout endpoint](/api/authentication?javascript#logout) as [described above](#log-out-a-user).

The external SAML identity provider will need to know where to send SAML logout requests (if initiating the logout) and responses. The __SingleLogout service URL__ that will consume this SAML messages is the following:

```text
https://${account.namespace}/logout
```

When viewing the logout metadata for your Auth0 Connection, you might notice two `SingleLogoutService` bindings with the above URL.

* The first is the **SAML Request Binding** (also known as the **Protocol Binding**), which is used for the transaction from Auth0 to the IdP. If the IdP provides a choice, select `HTTP-Redirect`.
* The second is the **SAML Response Binding**, which is used for transactions from the IdP to Auth0. It indicates to Auth0 what protocol the IdP will use to respond. If the IdP provides a choice, indicate that `HTTP-POST ` should be used for Authentication Assertions.

### Unable to Logout Using a SAML Identity Provider

When logging in (with Auth0 as the SAML Service Provider), the SAML identity provider uniquely identifies the user's session with a `SessionIndex` attribute in the `AuthnStatement` element of the SAML assertion. The `SessionIndex` value must be used again when the user logs out.

Occasionally, the `SessionIndex` value may not be present in the initial login assertion. When the user logs out, the request to the SAML identity provider will fail due to the missing value.

In these cases, Auth0 may not be able to complete a logout request to the SAML identity provider even if the logout URL has been configured correctly.

### Logout for Auth0 as SAML IdP

When Auth0 is acting as a [SAML Identity Provider](/protocols/saml/saml-idp-generic), you can have the following scenarios:

#### Single Logout Scenario

If your Service Provider supports SAML Single Logout, you will need to configure the Service Provider to call `https://${account.namespace}/samlp/CLIENT_ID/logout` (also listed in the SAML IdP Metadata). When a logout request is triggered by the Service Provider, a logout request will be sent to this endpoint and Auth0 starts the SAML SLO flow by notifying the existing session participants using a frontend channel.

* To prevent a session participant from being notified, you can set `logout.slo_enabled` to `false` in the `SAML2 Web App` application addon's settings. 
* To send the SAML Logout response using `HTTP-Redirect` bindings (instead of the default `HTTP-POST`), you can set `binding` to `urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect`.

#### Non Single Logout Scenario

If your Service Provider does not support SAML SLO, but provides a redirect URL where the user will be redirected to after logging out of the SP, the best thing to do is configure the redirect URL to `https://${account.namespace}/logout`. This won't notify other session participants that a logout was initiated, but it will at remove the session from Auth0.
