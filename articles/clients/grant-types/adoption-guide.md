# Adoption Guide: Client Grant Types

Beginning TBD, Auth0 is restricting use of legacy authorization flows. To manage this, we have implemented a new property on all Auth0 Clients called `grant_types`. Because the `client_grants` property is required, this guide provides suggestions on how to adapt your existing Clients to this change.

### Who is this guide for?

This guide is meant for developers and IT administrators who manage their applications' Auth0 integrations.

### Concepts and Terminology

* [Auth0 Clients](/clients)
* Authorization
  * [API](/api-auth)
  * [Client](/client-auth)
* [Multifactor Authentication](/multifactor-authentication)

### Do I need to implement these changes?

### When is the deadline to adopt these changes?
