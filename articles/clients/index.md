# Core Concepts: Clients

## Overview

An Auth0 **client** maps to your application and allows to use Auth0 for authentication. The term *client* does not imply any particular implementation characteristics. Your application can be a native app that executes on a mobile device, a single page app that executes on a browser, or a regular web app that executes on a server. The term is aligned with the [OAuth 2.0 specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749), where a client is defined as *an application making protected resource requests on behalf of the resource owner and with its authorization*.

## How to configure a Client in Auth0

Navigate to the [dashboard](${manage_url}) and click on the [Clients](${manage_url}/#/clients) menu option on the left. By default, you should have one client named *Default App*. You can either configure this one or create a new one by clicking the **+ Create Client** button.

The *Create Client* windows pops open. Set a descriptive name for your client and select the client type.

The client type should match your application:

- **Native**: Used for mobile, desktop or hybrid apps, than run natively in a device, like Android, Ionic or iOS. For a complete listing of the SDKs Auth0 offers for mobile apps refer to: [Native SDKs](/quickstart/native).

- **Single Page Web Applications**: Used for JavaScript front-end apps that run on a browser, like Angular, jQuery or React. For a complete listing of the SDKs Auth0 offers for SPAs refer to: [Single Page App SDKs](/quickstart/spa).

- **Regular Web Applications**: Used for traditional web applications that run on a server, like ASP .NET, Java or Node.js. For a complete listing of the SDKs Auth0 offers for Web Apps refer to: [Web App SDKs](/quickstart/webapp).

- **Non Interactive Clients**: Used for server to server applications like CLIs, daemons or services running on your backend. Typically you would use this option if you have a service that requires access to an API and you want it to request access tokens in order to do so.

After you set the name and client type, click **Create**.

Each client has four available tabs:

- [Quick Start](${manage_url}/#/clients/${account.clientId}/quickstart): Lists all available Quick Starts, filtered by your client's type.

- [Settings](${manage_url}/#/clients/${account.clientId}/settings): Lists all the available settings for your client.

- [Addons](${manage_url}/#/clients/${account.clientId}/addons): Add-ons are extensions associated with clients. They are typically third-party APIs used by the client(s) for which Auth0 generates access tokens. For more details refer to: [Addons](/clients/addons).

- [Connections](${manage_url}/#/clients/${account.clientId}/connections): Connections are sources of users. They are categorized into Database, Social and Enterprise and can be shared among different clients. For more details refer to: [Connections](/clients/connections). For a detailed list on the supported Identity Providers refer to: [Identity Providers Supported by Auth0](/identityproviders).


Click on the [Settings](${manage_url}/#/clients/${account.clientId}/settings) tab of your client to review the available settings:

- **Name**: The name of your client. This information is editable and you will see in the portal, emails, logs, and so on.

- **Domain**: Your Auth0 account name. Note that the domain name is chosen when you create a new Auth0 account and cannot be changed. If you need a different one you have to register for a new account by selecting *New Account* at the top right menu.

- **Client ID**: The unique identifier for your client. This is the ID you will use with when configuring authentication with Auth0. It is generated by the system when you create a new client and it cannot be modified.

- **Client Secret**: A base64 encoded string used to sign and validate tokens for authentication flows and to gain access to select Auth0 API endpoints. By default, the value is hidden, so check the **Reveal Client Secret** box to see this value.

- **Client Type**: The type of client you are implementing. Depending on which you choose, the available settings differ to show you only the settings applicable to your Client Type. You can change this value at any time by selecting one of the following: Native, Non Interactive Client, Regular Web Application, or Single Page Application.

- **First Party Client**: When a First Party client requests authorized against an API with the "Allow Skipping User Consent" flag set, the User Consent dialog will not be shown to the final user. If the hostname of your callbackURL is localhost or 127.0.0.1 the consent dialog will always be displayed.

- **Token Endpoint Authentication Method**: Defines the requested authentication method for the token endpoint. Possible values are `None` (public client without a client secret), `Post` (client uses HTTP POST parameters) or `Basic` (client uses HTTP Basic).

- **Allowed Callback URLs**: Set of URLs to which Auth0 is allowed to redirect the users after they authenticate. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them (typically to handle different environments like QA or testing). You can use the star symbol as a wildcard for subdomains (`*.google.com`). Make sure to specify the protocol, `http://` or `https://`, otherwise the callback may fail in some cases.

- **Allowed Logout URLs**: After a user logs out from Auth0 you can redirect them with the `returnTo` query parameter. The URL that you use in `returnTo` must be listed here. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them. You can use the star symbol as a wildcard for subdomains (`*.google.com`). Notice that querystrings and hash information are not taking into account when validating these URLs. Read more about this at: [Logout](/logout).

- **Allowed Origins (CORS)**: Set of URLs that will be allowed to make requests from JavaScript to Auth0 API (typically used with CORS). This prevents same-origin policy errors when using Auth0 from within a web browser. By default, all your callback URLs will be allowed. This field allows you to enter other origins if you need to. You can specify multiple valid URLs by comma-separating them. You can use the star symbol as a wildcard for subdomains (`*.google.com`). Notice that querystrings and hash information are not taking into account when validating these URLs.

- **JWT Expiration (seconds)**: The amount of time (in seconds) before the Auth0 [JWT](/jwt) expires. The default value is `36000`, which maps to 10 hours.

- **Use Auth0 instead of the IdP to do Single Sign On**: If enabled, this setting prevents Auth0 from redirecting authenticated users with valid sessions to the identity provider (such as Facebook, ADFS, and so on).

> You can use [Rules](/rules) to further customize the authentication process for your client. Within the context of a rule, you have access to the client the user is authenticating to, which is useful if you want to apply coarse-grained authorization policies for your clients, for example:
> - Only HR officials can access Client X
> - Only US-based users can access Client Y
>
> For more details on rules and how to use them refer to: [Rules](/rules).

## Sample Clients

The following are high-level overviews of sample Clients using a variety of technologies.

### Regular Web Application

![Example diagram](/media/articles/applications/applications-traditional.png)

For a regular web application, all you need to do is create a new Client in Auth0.

### Mobile Clients, a Single Page Application, and an REST API

![Example diagram](/media/articles/applications/applications-multiple-single-logical.png)

This example is a timesheet application that utilizes:

* A REST API that receives timesheet entries from users.
* A Single Page Application (SPA) used to log timesheets entries and send them to the REST API.
* Mobile apps capable of running on several types of devices, used to log timesheets entries and send them to the REST API.

In order to configure this in Auth0 you would create:
- A client for the SPA.
- A client for the iOS mobile app.
- A client for the Android mobile app.
- A client for the Windows mobile app.
- An API.

For more details on APIs and how to configure one refer to: [APIs](/apis).

### Multiple Services and APIs

![Example diagram](/media/articles/applications/applications-complex-different.png)

This example is for a Portal (HTML5 SPA) that communicates with four APIs.

In order to configure this in Auth0 you would create:
- A client for the SPA.
- An API for the Portal REST API.
- An API for the Documents API.
- An API for the Invoices API.
- An API for the Contacts API.

For more details on APIs and how to configure one refer to: [APIs](/apis).


## Auditing

![](/media/articles/applications/applications-logs-auditing.png)

The logs include many of the actions performed by the user:

* Logging in to a Client;
* Failing to log in to a Client;
* Signing up;
* Requesting a password change;

You can download the event logs using the [Management API](/api/management/v2#!/Logs/get_logs) or view them via the [Management Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/logs)

While the [Management Dashboard](${manage_url}/#/logs) displays the log data in a neatly formatted manner, clicking on the row corresponding to a particular event displays the raw data, which looks something like this:

```json
{
  "date": "2016-10-04T15:27:38.509Z",
  "type": "f",
  "description": "Invalid thumbprint (configured: 634AB4651FCA2F623563BE32EDA32DE565219118. calculated: BDEBFBFBA786C2D97F2125274793E32643358E81)",
  "connection": "SSOCircle",
  "connection_id": "con_T60D5poVozRmw77h",
  "client_id": "UEsQCe4RVHYDSQ2zlLWIAHSqDhpsYyTG",
  "client_name": "N/A",
  "ip": "108.248.62.158",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_6) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.143 Safari/537.36",
  "strategy": "samlp",
  "strategy_type": "enterprise"
}
```

### Sample User Count Calculation

Let's say that we have 3 active social users for the month of February:

![](/media/articles/applications/applications-single-app-active-users.png)

In the following month, John and Mary start using the company's collaboration application. This means that they'll become active users for this second application. All together, this means that there are a total of 5 active social users for the month of March:

 * Todo List: 3 active users
 * Collaboration Application: 2 active users

![](/media/articles/applications/applications-multi-app-active-users.png)


## Custom Domain Names

The public, multi-tenant cloud service version of Auth0 supports a domain name based off of `auth0.com`. Auth0 assigns Clients deployed using this service a domain name in one of the two formats:

* `{account-name}.auth0.com`;
* `{account-name}.{location}.auth0.com`.

For example, if your company is **My Company**, you would receive some or all the following addresses:

```
mycompany.auth0.com
mycompany.eu.auth0.com
mycompany.au.auth0.com
```

> With the Auth0 public cloud service, the `*.auth0.com` endpoints are only used for authentication and the API, *not* user access to your Client.

You may choose to use a custom domain name that obscures the Auth0 reference, such as `mycompany.com`. Using a custom domain name requires a *single-tenant* implementation of Auth0, which can be deployed in one of three locations:

* The Auth0-managed cloud.
* A customer-managed cloud.
* An on-premise installation.

Due to the additional features offered by these three options, these deployment options do come with a higher cost.

If you are unable to use a multi-tenant cloud service due to compliance or other policy requirements, please take a look at [the Auth0 appliance](/appliance).
