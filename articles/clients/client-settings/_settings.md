- **Name**: The name of your client. This information is editable and you will see in the portal, emails, logs, and so on.

- **Domain**: Your Auth0 tenant name. Note that the domain name is chosen when you create a new Auth0 tenant and cannot be changed. If you need a different one you have to register for a new tenant by selecting **+ Create Tenant** in the top right menu.

- **Client ID**: The unique identifier for your client. This is the ID you will use with when configuring authentication with Auth0. It is generated by the system when you create a new client and it cannot be modified.

- **Client Secret**: A string used to sign and validate `id_tokens` for authentication flows and to gain access to select Auth0 API endpoints. By default, the value is hidden, so check the **Reveal Client Secret** box to see this value.

  ::: warning
  While the Client ID is considered public information, the Client Secret **must be kept confidential**. If anyone can access your Client Secret they can issue  tokens and access resources they shouldn't.
