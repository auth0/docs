title: OAuth 2.0 Refresh Tokens
description: This tutorial demonstrates how to use Auth0 to renew Access Tokens using Refresh Tokens.
---

A Refresh Token is a special kind of token that can be used to obtain a renewed access token at any time. You can request new access tokens. Remember, Refresh Tokens must be stored securely by an application because they essentially allow a user to remain authenticated forever. For more information, check out [our documentation](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth).

## Obtaining a Refresh Token

To obtain a Refresh Token, you should include the `offline_access` scope in `auth0.login` `scope` parameter.

```js

...

// this function will be called when a user clicks the login button
function signIn() {
  auth0.login({
    responseType: 'id_token token',
    scope: 'openid profile offline_access {API SCOPES}',
    audience: '{API IDENTIFIER}'
  });
}

...
```

The Refesh Token will be available in `req.user.extraParams.refresh_token`.

## Using a Refresh Token

If you invoke your API and you get a `401` response, this tells you that you might need to refresh your Access Token since it is expired.

In order to renew your Access Token, you must send a request to the `/oauth/token` endpoint to obtain a renewed access token. Note that this quickstart assumes that the *Token Endpoint Authentication Method* setting for your Client is set to `POST`.

```js

// get refresh token

var options = { method: 'POST',
  url: `https://${process.env.AUTH0_DOMAIN}/oauth/token`,
  headers: { 'content-type': 'application/json' },
  body: {
    grant_type: 'refresh_token',
    client_id: '{env.AUTH0_CLIENT_ID}',
    client_secret: '{env.AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET}',
    refresh_token: req.user.extraParams.refresh_token
  },
  json: true
};

request(options, function (error, response, body) {
  // body.access_token is the renewed access token
  // use this renewed access token to invoke your API
});

```

You can optionally include the `scope` parameter, including any or all of the scopes that were originally requested. If you ask for scopes for which the user did not already provide consent, the returned `access_token` will not include them. If you specified the `openid` scope, you will also get back an `id_token`.

The renewed Access Token has an expiration time equal to the `Token Expiration (Seconds)` setting for your API.
