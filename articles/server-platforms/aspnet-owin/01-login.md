If you prefer to create a custom Login screen, refer to the [Custom Login step](/quickstart/webapp/aspnet-owin/02-login-custom).

Alternatively, you can simply carry on to the [Storing Tokens step](/quickstart/webapp/aspnet-owin/03-storing-tokens) which will demonstrate how you can store the tokens returned by Auth0.
