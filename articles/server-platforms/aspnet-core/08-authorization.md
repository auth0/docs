## Restrict an Action Based on a User's Roles

As mentioned before, the claims returned in the ID Token will automatically be mapped to claims on the `ClaimsIdentity`. ASP.NET Core will also map roles correctly.

Specifically, it will look for a "roles" claim on the ID Token, and then for each role inside the array on the "roles" claim, it will add a "http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/role" claim to the `ClaimsIdentity`.

This means that it integrates seamlessly with the [Role based authorization](https://docs.asp.net/en/latest/security/authorization/roles.html) inside ASP.NET Core.

Once the correct claims are being returned from Auth0, all you have to do therefore, is decorate your controller actions with the `[Authorize(Roles = ?)]` attribute.

The sample code below will restrict the particular action only to the user who have the "admin" role:

```csharp
[Authorize(Roles = "admin")]
public IActionResult Admin()
{
  return View();
}
```

## Ensure the Roles scope is requested

You will also need to ensure that you request the `roles` scope. This will ensure that the `roles` claim is returned in the `id_token`. Go back to the `Configure` method of the `Startup` class and update the registration of the OIDC middleware to request the `roles` scope:

```csharp
var options = new OpenIdConnectOptions("Auth0")
{
    // Code omitted for brevity...
};
options.Scope.Clear();
options.Scope.Add("openid");
options.Scope.Add("name");
options.Scope.Add("email");
options.Scope.Add("picture");
options.Scope.Add("country");
options.Scope.Add("roles");
app.UseOpenIdConnectAuthentication(options);
```
