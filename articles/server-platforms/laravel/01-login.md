**Otherwise, please follow the steps below to configure your existing Laravel web app to use it with Auth0.**

## Laravel Compatibility

The last version (2.x) targets Laravel 5 compatibility.

If you are working with an older version (Laravel 4.x) you need to point to composer.json to the version 1.0.*

### 1. Install the plugin and its dependencies

${snippet(meta.snippets.dependencies)}

### 2. Enable it in Laravel
Add the following in the list of the services providers, located in `config/app.php`

${snippet(meta.snippets.setup)}

Optionally, if you want to use the [facade](http://laravel.com/docs/facades) called `Auth0` you should also add an alias in the same file

```php
'aliases' => array(
    // ...
    'Auth0' => 'Auth0\Login\Facade\Auth0'
);
```

Now, you will be able to access to the logged user info with `Auth0::getUser()` and hook to the onLogin event  `Auth0::onLogin(function(...))`.

If you want to restrict access with the Auth0 Middleware, you will need to add it in `app/Http/Kernel.php`

```php
...

protected $routeMiddleware = [
		...
		'auth0.jwt' => '\Auth0\Login\Middleware\Auth0JWTMiddleware',
	];

...
```

Finally, you will need to bind a class that provides the users (your app model user) each time a user is logged in or a JWT is decoded. You can use the `Auth0UserRepository` provided by this package or build your own (which should implement the `\Auth0\Login\Contract\Auth0UserRepository` interface).
For this you need to add to your AppServiceProvider the following line:

```php
...

public function register()
{

    $this->app->bind(
        '\Auth0\Login\Contract\Auth0UserRepository',
        '\Auth0\Login\Repository\Auth0UserRepository');

}

...
```

### 3. Configure it

To configure the plugin, you need to publish the plugin configuration and complete the file `config/laravel-auth0.php` using the information of your Auth0 account.

To publish the example configuration file use this command

    php artisan vendor:publish

### 4. Setup the callback action

The plugin works with the [Laravel authentication system](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/authentication), but instead of using the `Auth::attempt` in a controller that handles a login form submit, you have to hookup the callback uri.

In other words, you need to select a uri (for example `/auth0/callback`) and configure it in your [Auth0 admin page](${uiURL}/#/applications) and also, add it as a route in Laravel

```php
Route::get('/auth0/callback', '\Auth0\Login\Auth0Controller@callback');
```

### 5. Triggering login manually or integrating the Auth0 widget

You can trigger the login in different ways, like redirecting to a login link or you can use [Lock](/lock), by adding the following javascript into a Laravel view or layout

${lockSDK}

### 6. Defining a user and a user provider

The [Laravel authentication system](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/authentication) needs a *User Object* given by a *User Provider*. With these two abstractions, the user entity can have any structure you like and can be stored anywhere. You configure the *User Provider* indirectly, by selecting an auth driver in `app/config/auth.php`. The default driver is Eloquent, which persists the User model in a database using the ORM.

#### 6.1. Using the auth0 driver

The plugin comes with an authentication driver called auth0. This driver defines a user structure that wraps the [Normalized User Profile](/user-profile) defined by Auth0, and it doesn't actually persist the object, it just stores it in the session for future calls.

This works fine for basic testing or if you don't really need to persist the user. At any point you can call `Auth::check()` to see if there is a user logged in and `Auth::user()` to get the wrapper with the user information.

To enable this driver, you need to change the following line in `/config/auth.php`:

```php
...
	'driver' => 'auth0',
...
```

If you need to implement a more advanced custom solution, you can always extend the Auth0UserRepository (or implement your own) in order to get and update the user data on your database and event more advaced validations.

#### 6.2. Using other driver

If you want to persist the user you can use the authentication driver you like. The plugin gives you a hook that is called with the *Normalized User Profile* when the callback is succesful, there you can store the user structure as you want. For example, if we use Eloquent, we can add the following code, to persist the user in the database

```php
Auth0::onLogin(function($auth0User) {
    // See if the user exists
    $user = User::where("auth0id", $auth0User->user_id)->first();
    if ($user === null) {
        // If not, create one
        $user = new User();
        $user->email = $auth0User->email;
        $user->auth0id = $auth0User->user_id;
        $user->nickname = $auth0User->nickname;
        $user->name = $auth0User->name;
        $user->save();
    }
    return $user;
});
```

Note that this hook must return the new user, which must implement the `Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable`. The onLogin function is going to be called just once, when the callback uri is called, then its up to the selected auth driver to get the user from the database.

### 7. Use it!

Now you can use Laravel middleware as you would normally do to restrict access, for example

```php
Route::get('admin', array('middleware' => 'auth0.jwt', function() {
    // ...
}));
```

Or add a logout action like this

```php
Route::get('/logout', function() {
    Auth::logout();
    return Redirect::home();
});
```

Enjoy!
