# Monitor Auth0

If you are using the public cloud version of Auth0, we recommend subscribing to [Auth0 Status](http://status.auth0.com) for notifications regarding Auth0 service availability. The Auth0 DevOps team uses [Auth0 Status](http://status.auth0.com) for reports on current incidents.

Current and historical uptime is available at [Auth0 Uptime](http://uptime.auth0.com).

## Monitor your Auth0 account

You can add Auth0 health probes to your monitoring infrastructure with the following endpoints:

### The test endpoint

The `test` endpoint checks the status of the core Auth0 authentication service. If the status is up, the endpoint returns a `200` status code; if is is not, it will return a `5xx` status code.

```har
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "https://${account.namespace}/test"
}
```

Additionally, this endpoint returns a JSON object:

```json
{
  "clock": 1417220191640
}
```

### The testall endpoint

The `/testall` endpoint checks the status of the core Auth0 authentication service, as well as supporting services such as those for the [Dashboard](${manage_url}) and documentation.

```har
{
  "method": "GET",
  "url": "https://${account.namespace}/testall"
}
```

If all services are up, the endpoint returns the `200` HTTP response code and a simple text message saying, `OK`. If any service is down, the response code from `/testall` will be `5xx`.

If you've extended Auth0 through [rules](/rules) or [a custom database connection](/connections/database/mysql), you can build a synthetic transaction that exercises these capabilities using the [Resource Owner Password Grant](/api-auth/tutorials/password-grant).

We recommend using an authentication flow that doesn't require a user interface (such as the **Resource Owner Password Grant**) so that you don't have to use a monitoring tool that is capable of mimicking the actions of a user. Many monitoring tools exist using this approach, including:

* [New Relic](http://newrelic.com)
* [Pingdom](http://pingdom.com)

## Monitor external services

If you are seeing potential issues with your Auth0 service, but the monitoring endpoints and the [Auth0 Status page](https://status.auth0.com) aren't indicating any problems, check the status of any external services that you use alongside Auth0.

* [Amazon Web Services](https://status.aws.amazon.com/)

## Monitor a dedicated deployment

Please see the [PSaaS Appliance](/appliance) pages for [information on monitoring a dedicated deployment](/appliance/monitoring).

## Configure SCOM

Auth0 can be monitored as a standard web application using System Center Operations Manager (SCOM) or any tool that supports synthetic transactions.

We recommend adding SCOM probes for the `test` and `testall` endpoints, in addition to one for a synthetic login transaction that includes the extensions your applications rely on (such as rules that execute custom code for integration with your company's other services).

To set up SCOM:

1. Add a new SCOM instance using the **Add Monitoring Wizard**:

  * **Name**: a descriptive name for the SCOM instance
  * **Description**: a description of what this SCOM instances monitors
  * **Select destination management pack**: Default Management Pack

  ![ss-2014-11-21T15-44-34.png](/media/articles/monitoring/ss-2014-11-21T15-44-34.png)

  Click **Next** to continue.

2. Click **Add** to enter the URLs you want SCOM to monitor.

  ![ss-2014-11-21T16-31-15.png](/media/articles/monitoring/ss-2014-11-21T16-31-15.png)

  Click **Next** to continue.

3. You will be asked where you want to monitor from. Click **Add** to set up a location. In the pop-up dialog, search for **Internal location - Agent**. Select the appropriate address and click **Add**. Click **Ok** to finish selecting the location.

  ![ss-2014-11-21T16-32-25.png](/media/articles/monitoring/ss-2014-11-21T16-32-25.png)

  Click **Next** to continue.

4. Set the frequency with which SCOM collects data from each endpoint:

  * **Test frequency**: 60 seconds
  * **Performance data collection interval**: 60 seconds
  * **Test time-out**: 30 seconds

  Additionally, under the *Alerts* section, **check** the box next to *HTTP status code* and set that to **Great than or equals 400**.

  ![ss-2014-11-21T16-33-51.png](/media/articles/monitoring/ss-2014-11-21T16-33-51.png)

  Click **Next** to continue.

5. Click **Run Test** to test each endpoint and ensure that the connection settings provided are correct.

Once you have finished configuring your SCOM instance, you can activity through the **Monitoring** tab:

![ss-2014-11-25T17-20-47.png](/media/articles/monitoring/ss-2014-11-25T17-20-47.png)

Click **Web Application Status** to bring up the information SCOM has gathered.
