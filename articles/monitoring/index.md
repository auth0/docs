## Log events

Need to analyze logs or store them long-term? Auth0 provides extensions to [export logs to external tools](/logs) for analysis and retention. You can also retrieve log data with the Management API. Auth0 only retains logs for a limited period of time, governed by the type of subscription purchased. If your required data retention period is longer than the retention period for your subscription,export logs so you can keep them as long as you wish.
