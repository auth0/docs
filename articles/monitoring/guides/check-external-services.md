# Check External Services Status

You may want to monitor any remote identity providers you use with your Auth0 connections to quickly isolate the source of the problem. 

If you see potential issues with your Auth0 service, but [Auth0 Status](https://status.auth0.com) doesn't indicate any problems, check the status of any external services that you use with Auth0, such as:

* [Amazon Web Services](https://status.aws.amazon.com/)
* [Azure Active Directory](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/status/)
* [Citrix](https://status.cloud.com/)
* [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/status/)
* [GitHub](https://status.github.com/)
* [Google Cloud](https://status.cloud.google.com/)
* [Google's G Suite](https://www.google.com/appsstatus#hl=en&v=status)
* [Heroku](https://status.heroku.com/)
* [IBM](https://console.bluemix.net/status)
* [Mandrill](http://status.mandrillapp.com/)
* [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/status/)
* [SAP](https://www.sap.com/about/cloud-trust-center/cloud-service-status.html)
* [SendGrid](http://status.sendgrid.com/)
* [SFDC](https://status.salesforce.com/)
* [Slack](https://status.slack.com/)
