# Monitor Applications

If you would like to monitor your own application or conduct end-to-end testing, youâ€™ll need to set up your own tests. 

If you've extended Auth0 through [rules](/rules) or a [custom database connection](/connections/database/custom-db), you can build a synthetic transaction that exercises these capabilities using the [Resource Owner Password Grant](/api-auth/tutorials/password-grant). One way of doing this is to [Monitor Auth0 Using SCOM](/monitoring/guides/monitor-using-SCOM).

Auth0 recommends using an authentication flow that doesn't require a user interface such as the **Resource Owner Password Grant**. That way, you can use a monitoring tool that doesn't have to mimick the actions of a user. Many monitoring services exist with this capability including:

* [New Relic](http://newrelic.com)
* [Pingdom](http://pingdom.com)

Use one of these services to execute synthetic authentication requests.
