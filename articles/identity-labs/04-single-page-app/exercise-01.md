# Lab 4, Exercise 1: Adding Sign On

::: warning
If you came to this page directly, go to the [first page of this lab](/identity-labs/04-single-page-app) and read through the instructions before getting started.
:::

In this lab, you will learn how to add sign-on capabilities to a Single-Page Application (SPA) and how to make this app consume an API that is secured with Auth0. You will integrate the SPA with Auth0 so that your users are able to use the Auth0 Universal Login Page to authenticate.

The SPA in question is a vanilla JavaScript application that consumes an API similar to the one you have used in previous labs (this API also exposes a secured endpoint that returns a list of expenses). The difference is that the API in this lab does two additional things:

- The API supports CORS to enable the SPA to consume it from a different domain (or a different port in a local environment).
- The API exposes a public endpoint that returns a summary of its database. The SPA consumes this endpoint on its homepage to share the summary publicly.

In this exercise, you will focus on integrating the SPA with Auth0 and getting the profile of the logged-in user. Exercise 2 will show how to consume the private endpoint exposed by the API.

1. First, you will run a version of the app that is not integrated with Auth0. Open a new terminal and browse to `/lab-04/exercise-01/begin/api` in your locally-cloned copy of the [identity exercise repo](https://github.com/auth0/identity-102-exercises/). This is where the code for your API resides. Install the dependencies using npm.

```bash
# Make sure we're in the right directory
‚ùØ pwd
/Users/username/identity-102-exercises/lab-04/exercise-01/begin/api

‚ùØ npm install
# Ignore any warnings

added XX packages in X.XXs
```

2. Make a copy of the `.env-sample` file and name it `.env`.

```bash
‚ùØ cp .env-sample .env
```

3. Edit the new `.env` file to add your tenant domain and save the file.

```text
PORT=3001
ISSUER_BASE_URL=https://${account.namespace}
ALLOWED_AUDIENCES=https://expenses-api
```

4. Run the API:

```bash
‚ùØ npm start
```

5. Open a new terminal in the `/lab-04/exercise-01/begin/spa` folder and run `http-server` to host the SPA.

```bash
# Navigating from the previous directory
‚ùØ cd ../spa

# Make sure we're in the right directory
‚ùØ pwd
/Users/username/identity-102-exercises/lab-04/exercise-01/begin/spa

‚ùØ npx http-server . -p 5000 -c-1
npx: installed 26 in 3.459s
Starting up http-server, serving .
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:5000
  http://10.10.10.10:5000
  http://192.168.1.4:5000
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

::: note
On the command above, `-p 5000` makes the server listen on port 5000, and `-c-1` makes browsers ignore their own cache. This last parameter is important to facilitate the development process.
:::

6. Open [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in a web browser, and you should see the page below. If you do not see the App Summary section, make sure your API is properly running at port 3001.

![Initial load for single-page application](/media/articles/identity-labs/lab-04-initial-load.png)

This is the homepage of your SPA. Right now, this SPA has no integration with Auth0. Also, the app is only consuming the public endpoint provided by the API. This endpoint returns two pieces of information: the total number of expenses recorded in the database (two, in this case), and the sum of their amount ($144.00). The SPA is using this information to feed the "App Summary" section of the page you are seeing.

7. To register this SPA with Auth0, log into the Auth0 Dashboard, go to the [Applications page](${manage_url}/#/applications), and click the **Create Application** button.

8. Set a descriptive name (e.g., "Identity Lab 4 - Single Page App"), choose **Single Page Web Application** for the type, and click **Create**.

9. You should now see the Quickstart section that describes how to integrate Auth0 with a production application. Click the **Settings** tab at the top to see the Application settings.

10. Add `http://localhost:5000/#callback` to the **Allowed Callback URLs** field. Auth0 will allow redirects **only** to the URLs in this field after authentication. If the one provided in the authorization URL does not match any in this field, an error page will be displayed.

11. Add `http://localhost:5000` to the **Allowed Web Origins** field. This field defines what URLs will be able to issue HTTP requests to Auth0 during a [silent authentication process](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/silent-authentication). Your SPA will leverage this mechanism to check whether the current browser has an active session on the Auth0 authorization server.

12. Add `http://localhost:5000` to the **Allowed Logout URLs** field. Auth0 will allow redirects **only** to the URLs in this field after logging out of the authorization server.

13. Scroll down and click **Show Advanced Settings**, then **OAuth**. Make sure **JsonWebToken Signature Algorithm** is set to `RS256`.

14. Scroll down and click **Save Changes**

Now that you have registered your SPA with Auth0, you can update your code to integrate both. Below is a summary of the steps you will execute:

- Import [auth0-spa-js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js) and configure it with your own Auth0 settings.
- Add code to handle the authentication callback.
- Add code to restrict content to authenticated users only.
- Implement login and logout.
- Obtain and display user profile information.

The [auth0-spa-js](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-spa-js) SDK is a simple, lightweight, and opinionated client developed by Auth0 that executes the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant Flow with PKCE. This client allows developers to quickly and securely implement authentication in their browser-based applications.

15. Open the `spa/index.html` file and search for the `<script>` tag that imports app.js. Right before that tag, add the auth0-spa-js library to your SPA using the CDN-hosted link.

```html
<!-- spa/index.html -->
<!-- ... -->

    <!-- Add the tag below üëá -->
    <script src="https://cdn.auth0.com/js/auth0-spa-js/1.1.1/auth0-spa-js.production.js"></script>

    <script src="app.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

16. Open `spa/app.js`. This file contains the code that starts your SPA in the browser. At the top of it, you will see several constants that reference DOM elements. Right after those definitions, add the variable declaration to allow `auth0Client` to be used globally.

```js
// spa/app.js
// ... other constants
const loadingIndicator = document.getElementById('loading-indicator');

// Add the line below üëá
let auth0Client;
```

17. In the `window.onload` function, add the code that configures the auth0-spa-js library with your own Auth0 details. Replace both placeholders with the **Domain** and **Client ID** properties for your SPA Application in Auth0.

```js
// spa/app.js
// ...

window.onload = async function() {
  let requestedView = window.location.hash;

  // Add the code below üëá
  auth0Client = await createAuth0Client({
    domain: '${account.namespace}',
    client_id: '${account.clientId}'
  });

  // ...
};
```

18. Implement the authentication callback after the snippet above in the `window.onload` function.

```js
// spa/app.js
// ...

window.onload = async function() {
  // ... code from the previous step

  // Add the code below üëá
  if (requestedView === '#callback') {
    await auth0Client.handleRedirectCallback();
    window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, '/');
  }

  // ...
};
```

The `requestedView` variable is used to identify if the request in question refers to a user coming back from the authentication process (i.e., if this is a user being redirected back to the application by Auth0 after authenticating).

19. Restrict site content to authenticated users only by finding the `allowAccess` function definition (at the bottom of the file) and replacing it with an authentication check.

```js
// spa/app.js
// ...

/* Replace the code below ‚ùå
async function allowAccess() {
  await loadView('#home', content);
  return false;
}
*/

// ... with this üëá
async function allowAccess() {
  if (await auth0Client.isAuthenticated()) {
    return true;
  }
  await loadView('#home', content);
  return false;
}
```

The goal of this function is to allow or deny access to whatever route calls it. This function is called from the `#expenses` route to ensure the user is logged in. Although you won't use that route on this exercise (only on the next one), you can check the code in the `spa/scripts/expenses.js` file. The previous version of this function was hardcoded always to deny access and redirect to the #home route because no authentication mechanism was in place yet.

You are now making use of the `isAuthenticated()` method provided by the SPA SDK to block unauthenticated users from accessing the route calling this function. If an anonymous user tries to access it, the app will detect that they are not authenticated and will redirect them back to the homepage.

20. To give users a way to log in and view restricted content, open the `spa/scripts/navbar.js` file. There, you will see the definition of a few constants within the `async function()` [IIFE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE). Below that, we'll add code to handle a click event on the login button.

```js
// spa/scripts/navbar.js
(async function() {
  // ... other constants
  const logOutButton = document.getElementById('log-out');

  // Add the code below üëá
  logInButton.onclick = async () => {
    await auth0Client.loginWithRedirect({
      redirect_uri: 'http://localhost:5000/#callback'
    });
  };

})();
```

The logInButton button will now, when clicked, invoke the `loginWithRedirect()` method provided by the SPA SDK to start the authentication process. When users click the login button, they will be redirected to the authorization server.

The `redirect_uri` property passed to the `loginWithRedirect()` method defines the URL that Auth0 must call after the authentication phase is concluded. This is the same URL listed in the **Allowed Callback URLs** field in the Auth0 Dashboard. If you use another URL without whitelisting it first, Auth0 will show an error page.

21. To define what happens when users click the logout button, add the code below right after the code from the previous step in the same function.

```js
// spa/scripts/navbar.js
(async function() {
  // ... code from the previous example

  // Add the code below üëá
  logOutButton.onclick = () => {
    auth0Client.logout({
      returnTo: 'http://localhost:5000'
    });
  };

})();
```

In this case, you are making the `logOutButton` button invoke the `logout()` method provided by the SPA SDK to end the user's Auth0 session. The `returnTo` property passed to this method works similar to the `redirect_uri` passed to the `loginWithRedirect()` method. This logout return URL was whitelisted in your Auth0 Application using the **Allowed Logout URLs** field.

22. Now, you will implement the behavior in your application that depends on whether the user is authenticated or not. After the code from the previous step, add the following code:

```js
// spa/scripts/navbar.js
(async function() {
  // ... code from the previous example

  // Add the code below üëá
  const isAuthenticated = await auth0Client.isAuthenticated();
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    const user = await auth0Client.getUser();
    profilePicture.src = user.picture;
    userFullname.innerText = user.name;

    logOutButton.style.display = 'inline-block';
  } else {
    logInButton.style.display = 'inline-block';
  }

})();
```

You defined a flag called `isAuthenticated` that defines if the user is authenticated or not. If they are authenticated, you use the `getUser()` method provided by the SPA SDK to extract their profile details. These details populate the screen with the name of the user and their picture.

The `isAuthenticated` flag also defines what button the app will show based on their authentication status: the `logInButton` or the `logOutButton`. If the user has a session with this application, the app will show the `logOutButton` button. Otherwise, it will show the `logInButton`.

23. Save all your changes and refresh the browser. You will see a screen that is slightly different from the previous one.

![Login button for single-page application](/media/articles/identity-labs/lab-04-login-button-showing.png)

24. In this new screen, click the **Log In** button to start the authentication process. Log in with your database user and accept the consent request. After successful authentication, Auth0 will redirect you back to your app, and your profile details (username and picture) will be shown near the upper-right corner:

::: note
If you log in using a social identity provider (Google, Facebook, etc.), you will need to log in every time you refresh the SPA. This happens because you are using Auth0‚Äôs test development keys for the identity provider. To prevent this from happening, you would need to register your application with the relevant Identity Provider and replace the test development keys on the Auth0 dashboard with your own. However, for the purposes of this lab, you should log in with a username and password to avoid the aforementioned behavior.

For more information, see [Test Social Connections with Auth0 Developer Keys](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/social/devkeys).
:::

If you want to test the `allowAccess()` function, which restricts access for particular routes depending on whether the user is authenticated, try navigating to [localhost:5000/#expenses](http://localhost:5000/#expenses). If you are logged in, the page will load successfully (the content for this page will be implemented in the next exercise). If you are not logged in, the app will redirect you to the homepage.

25. Let's explore the relevant network traces of the authentication process used in this lab. First, click the **Log Out** button, then, once you return to the app with your session ended, open Chrome's **Developer Tools** and go to the **Network** tab.

26. Click the **Log In** button. The first thing you will see in **Developer Tools** is a request similar to this:

```text
https://${account.namespace}/authorize?client_id=...
```

This request is created and triggered by the SPA SDK when a user clicks on the login button. If you check the query parameters passed alongside this URL, you will find, among others, the following:

- `client_id` - the unique identifier of your application for the authorization server.
- `response_type` - the artifacts needed to authenticate the user in your application. In this case, the SPA SDK is requesting an authorization code. This indicates to Auth0 that you will be using the [Authorization Code Grant Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/authorization-code-grant) (as defined by the OAuth 2.0 specification).
- `scope` - a space-delimited list of permissions that the application requires. In this case, your app is requesting `openid profile email`. These are scopes defined by the [OpenID Connect specification](/scopes/current/oidc-scopes) and give your app access to specific data in the user profile.
- `code_challenge` - this is a code that the authorization server will store and associate with the authorization request. In a future step, before issuing tokens to your application, the authorization server will use this code to verify (against another code called `code_verifier` that is handled internally by the SPA SDK) if it is secure to issue tokens. By using the code challenge and verifier, the SPA SDK is making the authorization process use a variant of the Authorization Code Grant Flow called PKCE.

27. Log in again by clicking **Log In**. After Auth0 redirects back to your application, check the **Network** tab in  **Developer Tools**, and you will see a list of requests, starting with the callback. Filter the requests and show only the XHR ones (those generated by an XMLHttpRequest JavaScript object).

28. Click on the "token" request (if there are two, click the second one). You will see that it is a `POST` request to the token endpoint of the authorization server. This request exchanges the code retrieved on the authentication process for the tokens needed in your application.

29. To see the data sent to the token endpoint, scroll to the bottom of the **Headers** tab. There, you will see that the request payload includes the following fields: `client_id`, `code`, `code_verifier`, `grant_type`, and `redirect_uri`.

![Network request for token endpoint POST](/media/articles/identity-labs/lab-04-token-ep-post.png)

30. Switch to the **Preview** tab to see the tokens returned by the authorization server.

::: note
If you are using a content blocker or browser setting that blocks third-party cookies, you will notice that in the step below, when authenticated, you need to log in again after refreshing the page. In that case, try changing your content blocker settings to allow your Auth0 domain (or turning it off altogether for localhost). Blocking all third-party cookies is not generally recommended as it is known to cause issues in some Web sites. This problem does not occur when [Custom Domains](/custom-domains) are used.
:::

31. If you refresh the SPA and change **Developer Tools** to filter requests by Doc (Documents), you will see a request called `authorize`. This request is similar to the one issued after the authentication process with a few differences:

- The request uses a different `response_mode`, in this case `web_message`. This is part of a strategy used to [renew tokens silently](/api-auth/tutorials/silent-authentication#renew-expired-tokens).
- The request defines a new query parameter called `prompt` set to `none`. As defined in the OpenID Connect protocol, this parameter is used on [authentication requests that must not display user interaction](https://auth0.com/docs/api-auth/tutorials/silent-authentication). This parameter is also part of the silent authentication process.

![Silent authentication network request from single-page application](/media/articles/identity-labs/lab-04-silent-auth-request.png)

For this to work properly, the silent authentication process requires the referrer URL to be whitelisted. This is why you added `http://localhost:5000` to the **Allowed Web Origins** field for your Auth0 Application. Otherwise, the silent authentication process would fail, and your users would need to log in again interactively.
