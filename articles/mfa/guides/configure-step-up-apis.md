# Configure Step-up Authentication for APIs

With step-up authentication, applications that allow access to different types of resources can require users to authenticate with a stronger mechanism to access sensitive information or perform certain transactions.

For instance, a user of a bankin app may be allowed to transfer money between accounts only after they have confirmed their identity using <dfn data-key="multifactor-authentication">multi-factor authentication (MFA)</dfn>.

When your <dfn data-key="audience">audience</dfn> is an API, you can implement step-up authentication with Auth0 using <dfn data-key="scope">scopes</dfn>, <dfn data-key="access-token">Access Tokens</dfn>, and [Rules](/rules/references/use-cases#multi-factor-authentication). 

## How it works

When an application wants to access an API's protected resources, it must provide an Access Token. The resources that it will have access to depend on the permissions that are included in the Access Token. These permissions are defined as **scopes**. 

For example, a banking API may accept two different levels of authorization: view account balance (scope `view:balance`) or transfer funds (scope `transfer:funds`). When an application asks the API to retrieve the user's balance, then the Access Token should contain the `view:balance` scope. To transfer money to another account, the Access Token should contain the `transfer:funds` scope.

The flow for this example:

1. The user logs in to the application using username/password authentication. The standard login gives this user the ability to interact with the API and fetch their balance. This means that the Access Token that the app receives after the user authenticates contains the `view:balance` scope.
2. The application sends a request to the API to retrieve the balance, using the Access Token as credentials.
3. The API validates the token and sends the balance info to the application, so the user can view it.
4. Now the user wishes to transfer funds from one account to another, which is deemed a high-value transaction that requires the `transfer:funds` scope. The application sends a request to the API using the same Access Token.
5. The API validates the token and denies access because the token is missing the required `transfer:funds` scope.
6. The application redirects to Auth0, where a rule is used to challenge the user to authenticate with MFA since a high-value scope was requested. Once the user successfully authenticates with MFA, a new Access Token that includes the correct scope is generated and sent to the application as part of the response.
7. The application sends another transfer funds request using the new Access Token, which includes the `transfer:funds` scope this time.
8. The API validates the token, discards it (thereby treating it like a single-use token), and proceeds with the operation.

## Validate Access Tokens

Besides checking the scope, the API must perform additional validation on the Access Token. It must also:

* verify the token's signature, which is used to verify that the sender of the token is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way. 

* validate the standard claims: 

    | Claim | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `exp` | Token expiration |
    | `iss` | Token issuer |
    | `aud` | Intended recipient of the token |

For more information, see [Validate an Access Token: Custom API Access Tokens](/tokens/guides/validate-access-tokens#custom-api-access-tokens).

## Sample scenario

In the following scenario, we will learn how to implement the flow described above.

For this example, we assume that we have already done the following:

- [Registered an application](/applications). For this example, we'll use a single-page web app.
- [Created a database connection](${manage_url}/#/connections/database).
- [Registered the API](/apis#how-to-configure-an-api-in-auth0). During this process, we should create two scopes: `view:balance` and `transfer:funds`.
- [Enabled Multi-factor Authentication](/mfa). For this example, we'll use push notifications.

1. Create a rule that challenges the user to authenticate with MFA when the `transfer:funds` scope is requested. Navigate to [Rules](${manage_url}/#/rules), and create a rule that contains the following content:

    ```js
    function(user, context, callback) {

      var CLIENTS_WITH_MFA = ['${account.clientId}'];
      // run only for the specified clients
      if (CLIENTS_WITH_MFA.indexOf(context.clientID) !== -1) {
        // ask for MFA only if scope transfer:funds was requested
        if (context.request.query.scope.indexOf('transfer:funds') > -1) {
          context.multifactor = {
            provider: 'any',
            allowRememberBrowser: false
          };
        }
      }

      callback(null, user, context);
    }
    ```

    - The `CLIENTS_WITH_MFA` variable holds the Client IDs of all the applications you want to use this rule. (You can remove this (and the `if` statement that follows) if you don't need it.)

    - The `context.request.query.scope` property contains all the scopes for which the authentication request asked. If it includes the value `transfer:funds`, then we ask for MFA by setting the `context.multifactor` property to the appropriate value. In this case, we are asking for MFA using [Push](/mfa/concepts/mfa-factors#push-notifications).

2. Configure the app to send the appropriate authentication request to the API, depending on whether the user is attempting to perform the high-value transaction of transferring funds. Notice that the only difference between the two authentication requests (with or without MFA) is the scope.

        state=OPAQUE_VALUE
        </code>
      </pre>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

| Parameter | Setting |
| --- | --- |
| `audience` | Set to the **Identifier** of your API (find it at [API Settings](${manage_url}/#/apis/)). We set ours to `https://my-banking-api`. |
| `response_type` | Set to `id_token token` so we get both an ID Token and an Access Token in the response. |
| `client_id` | Set to the Client ID of your application (find it at [Application Settings](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings)). |
| `redirect_uri` | Set to a URL in your application that Auth0 should redirect back to after authentication (find it at [Application Settings](${manage_url}/#/applications/${account.clientId}/settings)). |
| `nonce` | Set to a secure string value which will be included in the response from Auth0. This is [used to prevent token replay attacks](/api-auth/tutorials/nonce) and is required for `response_type=id_token token`. |
| `state` | Set to an opaque value that Auth0 includes when redirecting back to the application. This value must be used by the application to [prevent CSRF attacks](/protocols/oauth2/oauth-state). |

3. Configure the API to validate the incoming token according to the steps described in the [Validate Access Tokens](#validate-access-tokens) section and check the authorized permissions. 

    In this scenario, we will configure two endpoints for our API:

    - `GET /balance`: to retrieve the current balance
    - `POST /transfer`: to transfer funds

    We will use `Node.js` and a number of modules:

    - [express](https://expressjs.com/): adds the Express web application framework.
    - [jwks-rsa](https://github.com/auth0/node-jwks-rsa): retrieves RSA signing keys from a **JWKS** (JSON Web Key Set) endpoint. Using `expressJwtSecret`, we can generate a secret provider that will issue the right signing key to `express-jwt` based on the `kid` in the JWT header.
    - [express-jwt](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt): lets you authenticate HTTP requests using JWT tokens in your Node.js applications. It provides several functions that make working with JWTs easier.
    - [express-jwt-authz](https://github.com/auth0/express-jwt-authz): checks if the Access Token contains a specific scope.

    Start with installing the dependencies:

    `npm install express express-jwt jwks-rsa express-jwt-authz --save`

    Next, define the API endpoints, create a middleware function to validate the Access Token, and secure the endpoints using that middleware. The code in your `server.js` file should look like the following sample script:

    ```js
    // set dependencies
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    const jwt = require('express-jwt');
    const jwksRsa = require('jwks-rsa');
    const jwtAuthz = require('express-jwt-authz');

    // Create middleware for checking the JWT
    const checkJwt = jwt({
      // Dynamically provide a signing key based on the kid in the header and the signing keys provided by the JWKS endpoint
      secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
        cache: true,
        rateLimit: true,
        jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
        jwksUri: `https://${account.namespace}/.well-known/jwks.json`
      }),

      // Validate the audience and the issuer
      audience: 'https://my-banking-api', // replace with your API's audience, available at Dashboard > APIs
      issuer: 'https://${account.namespace}/',
      algorithms: [ 'RS256' ] // we are using RS256 to sign our tokens
    });

    // create retrieve balance endpoint
    app.get('/balance', checkJwt, jwtAuthz(['view:balance']), function (req, res) {
      // code that retrieves the user's balance and sends it back to the calling app
      res.status(201).send({message: "This is the GET /balance endpoint"});
    });


    // create transfer funds endpoint
    app.post('/transfer', checkJwt, jwtAuthz(['transfer:funds']), function (req, res) {
      // code that transfers funds from one account to another
      res.status(201).send({message: "This is the POST /transfer endpoint"});
    });

    // launch the API Server at localhost:8080
    app.listen(8080);
    console.log('Listening on http://localhost:8080');
    ```

    Each time the API receives a request the following happens:

    1. The endpoint calls the `checkJwt` middleware.
    2. `express-jwt` decodes the token and passes the request, the header, and the payload to `jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret`.
    3. `jwks-rsa` downloads all signing keys from the JWKS endpoint and checks if one of the signing keys matches the `kid` in the header of the Access Token. If none of the signing keys match the incoming `kid`, an error is thrown. If there is a match, we pass the right signing key to `express-jwt`.
    4. `express-jwt` continues its own logic to validate the signature of the token, the expiration, audience, and the issuer.
    5. `jwtAuthz` checks if the scope that the endpoint requires is part of the Access Token.
