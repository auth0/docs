# MFA Theme Language Dictionary

## defaultLocation

```js
return new Auth0MFAWidget({

...

  defaultLocation : ['United Kingdom', 'GB', '+44'],
  
...

})
```

## languageDictionary

The `languageDictionary` can be used to override the text for many areas of the MFA process on Universal Login Classic Experience. You do this with the following format:

```
languageDictionary:
  optionsCategory:
    option: value
```

Here is an example, modifying the `headerText` attribute in `smsEnrollmentConfirm`:

```js
return new Auth0MFAWidget({

...

  languageDictionary:{ // Use the Language Dictionary option
    smsEnrollmentConfirm:{  // Indicate which category/section you are modifying
      headerText: "Some custom text - In order to confirm enrollment we need to confirm your phone. Please enter the received code." // Provide the new value for the specific attribute you wish to modify
    }
  }

...

})
```

See below for a list of available categories and options.

### languageDictionary options

```js
defaults: {
  iddleHelpUrl: '#',
  rememberBrowserCheckbox: 'Remember this browser',
  title: 'Login to {tenantName}'
