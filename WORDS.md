## Dashboard-Related Terminology

![](/media/readme/structure.png)

### Account

Represents a user, their credentials, and (optionally) a profile and other attributes


### Subscription

Defines custom terms; this is a contract or service plan e.g. trial, free, developer or developer-pro

### Tenant

A logical isolation unit of the products we offer. e.g. a tenant of Auth0 would be `foo.auth0.com` vs. another tenant `bar.auth0.com`.

### Tokens

When writing about tokens, capitalize specific token names as follows:

* ID Token
* Access Token
* Refresh Token

#### Within Appliance subscriptions

* **Auth0 tenants** refers to regular cloud tenants
* **Private instances** refers to appliance instances

### TL;DR

Generally speaking, unless you're referring to MFA configuration, payment options, or user profiles (for the *owner* of the account), you'll use `tenant`, not `account`.
