    title: "Gradle include file for reusage"
    tags:
      - quickstart
      - android
    description: |
      The _auth0.md and the _api_authz.md files were both using redundant and inconsistent gradle instructions. A _gradle file was created on the includes for reusage and consistency.
fixed:
  -
    title: "Android SDK doc used deprecated compile"
    tags:
      - android
      - library
      - save-and-refresh-tokens
    description: |
      The save-and-refresh-tokens.md file used deprecated `compile` instead of `implementation`. To keep consistency the file points to the docs.
