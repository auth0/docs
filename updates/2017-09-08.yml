    description: |
      A new doc was added for the [Mobile+API architecture scenario](/architecture-scenarios/application/mobile-api). The scenario features a mobile app (with an accompanying Android sample) which uses an API (sample in Node.js). The application uses OpenID Connect and the [Native/Mobile Login Flow](/flows/concepts/mobile-login-flow) to authorize users with Auth0.
