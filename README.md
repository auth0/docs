# Auth0 Documentation

This is the repository for the Auth0 documentation content. All content for the Auth0 documentation site (including Quickstarts) can be found here, with the following exceptions:

* If you are looking for the actual application which *hosts* the content, that is located in the [auth0-docs](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-docs) repository (team access required).
* If you need to modify the Management API v2 API docs, they draw their content from the [api2](https://github.com/auth0/api2) repository (team access required).

**Please review the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before sending a PR or opening an issue.**

## Running the Docs Site

You can run and test the docs site locally (you will need access - only employees). For instructions on running the site and testing see the [README](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-docs/blob/master/README.md) (requires Auth0 team access). You may also edit Documentation content by simply committing changes to this repository, as they will be tested against a Docs site instance in review.
