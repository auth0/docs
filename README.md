# Auth0 Documentation
This is the repository for the Auth0 documentation.

## Contributing Guidelines
* Read and follow the [STYLEGUIDE](STYLEGUIDE.md)
* Always use absolute links from the root of the site. Note, that your links should NOT start with `/docs` or any other base path. If the site is hosted with a base like on `auth0.com/docs` the links will be corrected at runtime.
* Do not hard code links to auth0 sites like `docs.auth0.com`, `manage.auth0.com`, etc. Use variables instead such as `${uiUrl}`
* Do not store images in external locations like Dropbox, CloudUp, or the Auth0 CDN. Link to images in this repo using `![](/media/folder/image_name.png)`. The image will get automatically uploaded to the CDN and the link will be transformed.
* Try to keep images to no more than 750 pixels wide


## Test Procedures
When testing a document or tutorial below are several areas to look for.

1. Ensure that the code in the tutorials is correct and functions as expected
1. Ensure that the steps (1..n) are in an order that makes sense and that there are no missing or duplicate steps.
1. Check for broken links
1. Check for old screenshots (both in auth0's dashboard/product and on referenced third-party sites)
1. Ensure that the code in the seed project that you download functions as expected
1. Check for outdated dependencies (both auth0 dependencies and third-party i.e. node modules, nuget packages, gems, etc.)

## Quickstarts
All quickstart data comes directly from the docs API at `/meta/quickstart`. This means that the quickstart on docs and manage will both consume the same datasource and will always be up to date. To add a new quickstart you simply need to add the markdown document in the appropriate folder: [server-apis](/articles/server-apids), [server-platforms](/articles/server-platforms), [native-platforms](/articles/native-platforms), or [client-platforms](/articles/client-platforms). The only requirement is that you need to specify the correct front matter.

For all quickstart docs, provide the following:

```yaml
---
title: Document Title
name: Quickstart Name
image: //cdn.auth0.com/path/to/icon.png
thirdParty: true|false  # For server apis only
hybrid: true|false # For native platforms only
snippets:
  dependencies: folder/dependencies.html
  setup: folder/app.js
  use: folder/login.js
---
```

For each quickstart you must specify the snippets and create the associated snippet file in the `/snippets` folder. You must provide all three snippets for each quickstart: `dependencies`, `setup`, and `use`. To include the snippet in the quickstart document simply reference it:

```md
${snippet(meta.snippets.use)}
```

After you publish the doc update, the new quickstart will automatically appear on both docs and manage.

Additionally, the quickstart configuration is also in this repository here: [quickstart.yml](/quickstart.yml).

## API

> WARNING: This API is for Auth0 internal use only. You should not rely on the docs API for anything. There is *NO SLA or support* for the document API.

All document content is accessible through the docs API as well as through regular HTML.

To request a document in embedded format (i.e. no template html) to embed externally simply append `?e=1` to any url.

To request a document in the framed format (i.e. no header, footer, or naviation) to use in a window popup or an iframe simply append `?framed=1` to any url.

To request content in JSON or JSONP format simply pass the header `Accept: 'application/json'` and optionally specify a ``?callback=foo` query parameter for JSONP.

In the JSON or JSONP responses you can also request the document metadata by appending `?m=1` to the query.

## Code snippets
Code snippets are available both through the API and to use in markdown docs.

Access via API:

GET: `/docs/meta/snippets/{hash}`
Response:
```json
{
  "title": "{title}",
  "content": "{<pre><code class="{class}">{code}</code></pre> }",
  "hash": "{hash}"
  "additional_metadata": ""
}
```

Use in markdown docs:

```md
${snippet('{hash}')}
```

## Connections
Connections are available both through the API and to use in markdown docs.

Access via API:

GET: `/docs/meta/connections`
GET: `/docs/meta/connections/{type}`
GET: `/docs/meta/connections/{type}/{connection}`
Response:
```json
{
  "title": "{title}",
  "hash": "{hash}",
  "url": "https://auth0.com/docs/path/to/doc",
  "image": "https://cdn.auth0.com/docs/path/to/image.png",
  "type": "database|social|enterprise",
  "alias": [
