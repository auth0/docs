# Security Update for express-jwt Library

**Published**: June 30, 2020

**CVE number**: CVE 2020-15084

**Credit**: IST Group

## Overview
Versions before and including 5.3.3, we are not enforcing the **algorithms** entry to be specified in the configuration.
When **algorithms** is not specified in the configuration, with the combination of jwks-rsa or potentially other asymmetric crypto libraries, it may lead to authorization bypass. 

## Am I affected?
You are affected by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply:

You are using express-jwt
AND 
You do not have **algorithms**  configured in your express-jwt configuration.
AND
You are using libraries such as jwks-rsa as the **secret**. 

## How to fix that?
Specify **algorithms** in the express-jwt configuration. The following is an example of a proper configuration

``` 
const checkJwt = jwt({
  secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
    rateLimit: true,
    jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
    jwksUri: `https://{DOMAIN}/.well-known/jwks.json`
  }),
  // Validate the audience and the issuer.
  audience: process.env.AUDIENCE,
  issuer: `https://{DOMAIN}/`,
  // restrict allowed algorithms
  algorithms: ['RS256']
}); 
```

## Will this update impact my users?
The fix provided in the patch will not affect your users if you specified the algorithms allowed. The patch now makes **algorithms** a required configuration.
