# Identity Provider Access Tokens

Third-party <dfn data-key="access-token">Access Tokens</dfn> are issued by [Identity Providers](/identityproviders) after a user authenticates with that provider. Use the Access Tokens to call the API of the third-party provider that issued them. For example, an Access Token issued after authentication to Facebook could be used to call the Facebook Graph API.

The user authenticates with the IdP by making an HTTP `GET` call to [the /api/v2/user/{user-id} endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users_by_id). To call this endpoint you need an [Access Token for the Management API](/api/management/v2/tokens) that includes the `read:user_idp_tokens` <dfn data-key="scope">scope</dfn>. The Access Token for the IdP will be available in the `identities` array, under the element for the particular connection. For information on how to call an IdP API, see [Call an Identity Provider API](/connections/calling-an-external-idp-api).

::: warning
The contents of third-party Access Tokens will vary depending on the issuing identity provider. Because tokens are created and managed by a third-party (such as Facebook, GitHub, etc.), **the validity period for third-party tokens will vary by the issuing IdP**. If you believe these tokens have been compromised, you will need to revoke or reset them with the third-party that issued them.

## Renew tokens

There is no standard way to renew IdP Access Tokens through Auth0. The mechanism for renewing IdP Access Tokens varies for each provider.

For certain identity providers, Auth0 can store a <dfn data-key="refresh-token">[Refresh Token](/tokens/concepts/refresh-token)</dfn>, which you can use to obtain a new Access Token for the IdP. Here is a list of some of the identity providers:

* BitBucket
* Google OAuth 2.0 (pass the parameter `access_type=offline`, as well the `connection_scope` parameter with required scopes, when calling the Auth0 `/authorize` endpoint)
* Any other OAuth 2.0 IdP
* SharePoint
* Azure AD

Get the IdP Refresh Tokens in the same way as Access Tokens, using [the /api/v2/user/{user-id} endpoint](/api/management/v2#!/Users/get_users_by_id). The Refresh Tokens will be available in the `identities` array, under the element for the particular connection.

## Validate tokens

If you have received an Access Token from an [Identity Provider (IdP)](/identityproviders), in general, you don't need to validate it. You can pass it to the issuing IdP, and the IdP takes care of the rest.
