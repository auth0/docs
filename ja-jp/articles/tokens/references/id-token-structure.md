# ID Token Structure

ID Tokens follow the <dfn data-key="json-web-token">[JSON Web Token (JWT)](/tokens/concepts/jwts)</dfn> standard, which means that their basic structure conforms to the typical [JWT Structure](/tokens/references/jwt-structure), and they contain standard [JWT Claims](/tokens/concepts/jwt-claims) asserted about the token itself.

However, beyond what is required for JWT, ID Tokens also contain claims asserted about the authenticated user, which are pre-defined by the [OpenID Connect (OIDC)](/protocols/oidc) protocol, and are thus known as standard OIDC claims. Some standard OIDC claims include:

* `name`
* `nickname`
* `picture`
* `email`
* `email_verified`

For a full list of standard OIDC claims, see [OIDC specification: Standard Claims](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#StandardClaims).

You control which OIDC claims are included in the ID Token consumed by your application by including specific [OpenID Connect Scopes](/scopes/oidc-scopes) in a parameter when you request tokens while authenticating users. To learn how to request an ID Token, see [Get ID Tokens](/tokens/guides/get-id-tokens).

::: note 
You can also create [custom claims](/tokens/concepts/jwt-claims#custom-claims), which are claims that you define, control, and add to a token using a [rule](/rules).
