# Validate JSON Web Tokens

::: note
This document is intended for developers implementing a regular web, native, or SPA application. All of our [backend API quickstarts](/quickstart/backend) use SDKs that perform JWT validation and parsing for you.

If you'd like to visually inspect a JWT, visit [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/) or use the [JWT Debugger Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jwt-debugger/ppmmlchacdbknfphdeafcbmklcghghmd?hl=en)).
:::

To parse and validate a <dfn data-key="json-web-token">JSON Web Token (JWT)</dfn>, you can:

* Use any existing [middleware](#middleware) for your web framework.
* Choose a [third-party library](#third-party-libraries) from [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io).
* [Manually implement the checks](#manually-implement-the-checks) described in [specification RFC 7519 > 7.2 Validating a JWT](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-7.2).

::: warning
We strongly recommend that you use middleware or one of the existing open source third-party libraries to parse and validate JWTs. At [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io), you can find libraries for various platforms and languages, such as .NET, Python, Java, Ruby, Objective-C, Swift, and PHP.
:::

## Middleware

Many web frameworks, such as [ASP.NET Core](/quickstart/backend/aspnet-core-webapi), include JWT middleware that handles JWT validation. Typically, this is the best route to take because the middleware integrates well with the framework's overall authentication mechanisms.

## Third-party libraries

If you choose a third-party library, remember to pick a library that supports the [signing algorithm](/tokens/concepts/signing-algorithms) you selected when you registered your application or API with Auth0. Also, be aware that not all libraries validate all JWT claims. At [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/), you can see which validations each library supports (look for the green check marks).

Most third-party libraries will implement one method to verify a JWT and build in various arguments to allow you to customize the verification.

For example, if you are using Node.js and the [node-jsonwebtoken library](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken), then you would call the [jwt.verify()](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jwtverifytoken-secretorpublickey-options-callback) method. This method supports an `algorithms` argument to allow you to customize your allowed algorithms (make sure you disallow `none`), a `secretOrPublicKey` argument that you populate with either the secret or the RSA public key (depending on selected signing algorithm), and other input arguments that allow you to customize claim validation. If parsing fails, then the library returns a [JsonWebTokenError error](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken#jsonwebtokenerror) with the message `jwt malformed`, after which you **must** reject the associated request.

## Manually implement the checks

::: note
All Auth0-issued JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are JSON Web Signatures (JWS), meaning they are signed rather than encrypted. As such, this section describes validation for JWSs. If you need to validate a JSON Web Encryption (JWE), see [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519#section-7.2) for instructions specific to that type of JWT.
:::

To validate a JWT, your application needs to:

1. Check that the JWT is well formed.
2. Check the signature.
3. Check the standard claims.

If any of these steps fail, then the associated request must be rejected.

::: note
Most JWT libraries take care of JWT validation for you, so be sure to visit [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/#libraries-io) to find a JWT library for your platform and programming language.
:::

## Check that the JWT is well-formed

Ensure that the JWT conforms to the [structure of a JWT](/tokens/references/jwt-structure). If this fails, the token is considered invalid, and the request must be rejected.

1. Verify that the JWT contains three segments, separated by two period ('.') characters.
2. Parse the JWT to extract its three components. The first segment is the Header, the second is the Payload, and the third is the Signature. Each segment is base64url encoded.
3. Base64url-decode the Header, ensuring that no line breaks, whitespace, or other additional characters have been used, and verify that the decoded Header is a valid JSON object.
4. Base64url-decode the Payload, ensuring that no line breaks, whitespace, or other additional characters have been used, and verify that the decoded Payload is a valid JSON object.

## Check the signature

The last segment of a JWT is the Signature, which is used to verify that the token was signed by the sender and not altered in any way. The Signature is created using the Header and Payload segments, a [signing algorithm](/tokens/concepts/signing-algorithms), and a secret or public key (depending on the chosen signing algorithm).

To verify the signature, you will need to:

1. Check the signing algorithm.

    1. Retrieve the `alg` property from the decoded Header.
    2. Ensure that it is an allowed algorithm. Specifically, to avoid certain attacks, make sure you disallow `none`.
    3. Check that it matches the algorithm you selected when you [registered your Application](/getting-started/set-up-app) or [API](/getting-started/set-up-api) with Auth0.
2. Confirm that the token is correctly signed using the proper key.

    To verify that the signature is correct, you need to generate a new Base64url-encoded signature using the public key (RS256) or secret (HS256) and verify that it matches the original Signature included with the JWT:

    1. Take the original Base64url-encoded Header and original Base64url-encoded Payload segments (Base64url-encoded Header + "." + Base64url-encoded Payload), and hash them with SHA-256.
    2. Encrypt using either HMAC or RSA (depending on your selected signing algorithm) and the appropriate key.
    3. Base64url-encode the result.

    ::: panel Locate Public Key

    For RS256:
    Retrieve the public key from the [JWKS](/tokens/concepts/jwks) located by using your [Auth0 discovery endpoint](/tokens/guides/locate-jwks).

    For debugging purposes, you can visually inspect your token at [jwt.io](jwt.io); for this purpose, you can also locate your public key in the Auth0 Dashboard. Look in **Applications**>**Settings**>**Advanced Settings**>**Certificates** and locate the **Signing Certificate** field.

    For HS256:
    Retrieve the `client_secret` from Auth0's Management API using the [Get a Client endpoint](/api/management/v2/#!/Clients/get_clients_by_id). 

    For debugging purposes, you can visually inspect your token at [jwt.io](jwt.io); for this purpose, you can also locate your secret in the Auth0 Dashboard. For applications, look in **Settings** and locate the **Client Secret** field. For APIs, look in **Settings** and locate the **Signing Secret** field. (Note that this field is only displayed for APIs using the HS256 [signing algorithm](/tokens/concepts/signing-algorithms).)
    :::

    If the generated signature does not match the original Signature included with the JWT, the token is considered invalid, and the request must be rejected.

## Check standard claims

Before using the token, you should retrieve the following standard claims from the decoded Payload and perform the following checks:

* **Token expiration** (`exp`, Unix timestamp): The expiration date/time must be after the current date/time.
* **Token issuer** (`iss`, string): The issuing authority inside the token must match the issuing authority (`issuer`) identified in your Auth0 tenant's discovery document, which exists at `https://${account.namespace}/.well-known/openid-configuration`.

Additional checks are required depending on whether the JWT you are validating is an ID Token or an Access Token. To learn about the additional requirements, see [Validate ID Tokens](/tokens/guides/validate-id-tokens) or [Validate Access Tokens](/tokens/guides/validate-access-tokens).
