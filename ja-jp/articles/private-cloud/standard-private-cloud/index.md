# Private Cloud

Auth0's **Private Cloud** option provides you with a dedicated (or single-subscriber) environment. You'll get enhanced performance, security, and compliance over what we include in our standard Public Cloud offering.

With the Private Cloud, Auth0 will handle a majority of the requirements for initial setup and maintenance. Afterward, you'll be on a set update pattern, typically no more frequent than every 30 days.

You'll get the ease of management that comes with using our Public Cloud combined with the power and security of our [Managed Private Cloud](/private-cloud/managed-private-cloud).
