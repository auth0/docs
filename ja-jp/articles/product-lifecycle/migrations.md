# Active Migrations

We are actively migrating customers to new behaviors for all <dfn data-key="deprecation">Deprecations</dfn> listed below. Please review these carefully to ensure you've taken any necessary steps to avoid service disruption. To learn more, see [Migration Process](/product-lifecycle/migration-process).

      <td>26 January 2021</td>
      <td>
        After 26 January 2021, requests to the following Management API v2 endpoints will return a maximum of 50 items for Public Cloud tenants. To retrieve more items, you must include the <code>page</code> and <code>per_page</code> parameters. Beginning on 21 July 2020, Auth0 will display tenant logs and a migration toggle to help you prepare for this change.
        <ul>
          <li><code>GET /api/v2/clients</code>
          <li><code>GET /api/v2/client-grants</code>
          <li><code>GET /api/v2/grants</code>
          <li><code>GET /api/v2/connects</code>
          <li><code>GET /api/v2/device-crecentials</code> (when <code>type</code> query parameter is used)
          <li><code>GET /api/v2/resource-servers</code>
          <li><code>GET /api/v2/rules</code>
        </ul>
        All Public Cloud tenants are affected that are created before 21 July 2020 and are actively calling affected endpoints without passing the <code>per_page</code> parameter for queries that can return more than 1 result.
        Tenants are not affected if they are created after 21 July 2020, are not using the affected endpoints, are using the affected endpoints and passing the <code>per_page</code> parameter, or are making queries that always return only 1 result.

        The Webtask engine powering Auth0 extensibility points currently uses Node 8. Beginning <strong>31 December 2019</strong>, <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule">Node.js v8 was no longer under long-term support (LTS)</a>. This means that critical security fixes were no longer back-ported to this version. As such, Auth0 is migrating the Webtask runtime from Node.js v8 to Node.js v12.<br><br>On <strong>15 April 2020</strong>, we made the Node 12 runtime available for extensibility to all public cloud customers. You have been provided a migration switch that allows you to control your environment's migration to the new runtime environment.<br><br>To learn more about this migration and the steps you should follow to upgrade your implementation, see <a href="/migrations/guides/extensibility-node12">Migration Guide: Extensibility and Node.js v12</a>.
