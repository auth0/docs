Most single-page apps use resources from data APIs. You may want to restrict access to those resources, so that only authenticated users with sufficient privileges can access them. Auth0 lets you manage access to these resources using [API Authorization](/api-auth).

This tutorial shows you how to access protected resources in your API. 

::: note
This tutorial does not show you how to add protection to your API. Read the [Backend/API quickstart documentation](quickstart/backend) for instructions on how to protect your API.
