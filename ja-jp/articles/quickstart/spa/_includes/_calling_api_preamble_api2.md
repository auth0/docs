The focus of this guide is to show you how to configure the SDK to call APIs protected by OAuth 2. Instead of creating a demo API to test the client-server connection, you'll use the [Auth0 Management API](https://auth0.com/docs/api#management-api), which comes bundled with your Auth0 tenant. However, you can adapt this guide to work with any API that you are securing with Auth0.
