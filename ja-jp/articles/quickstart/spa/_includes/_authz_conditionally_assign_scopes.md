## Conditionally Assign Scopes to Users

By default, when you register scopes in your API settings, all the scopes are immediately available and any user can request them. 
If you want to handle access control, you need to create policies for deciding which users can get which scopes. 

::: note
You can use Rules to create access policies. See the [Rules documentation](/rules) to learn how to use Rules to create scope policies.
