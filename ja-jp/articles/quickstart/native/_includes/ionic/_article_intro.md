## Getting started

This quickstart assumes you already have an [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) application up and running with [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/). If not, check out the [Using Capacitor with Ionic Framework guide](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/with-ionic) to get started with a simple app, or clone [our sample apps](https://github.com/auth0-samples/auth0-ionic-samples).

You should also be familiar with the [Capacitor development workflow](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/basics/workflow).
