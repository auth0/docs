Auth0 allows you to store data related to each user that has not come from the identity provider. This is known as metadata. There are two kinds of metadata, **user_metadata** and **app_metadata**. You can read about both of these at [app_metadata and user_metadata](/api/v2/changes#app-_metadata-and-user-_metadata).
