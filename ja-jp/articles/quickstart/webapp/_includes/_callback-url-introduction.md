Callback URLs are the URLs that Auth0 invokes after the authentication process. Auth0 routes your application back to this URL and attaches some details to it including a token. Since callback URLs can be manipulated, you will need to add your application's URL in the app's `Allowed Callback URLs` for security. This will enable Auth0 to recognize these URLs as valid. If omitted, authentication will not be successful for the app instance.
