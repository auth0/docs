## Sample Use Cases

### Customize Tokens

You can use [Hooks](/hooks) to change the returned scopes of Access Tokens and/or add claims to them. Auth0 invokes Hooks attached to the client credentials grant at runtime to execute your custom logic.

For more information, see our tutorial on [Using Hooks with the Client Credentials Grant](/api-auth/tutorials/client-credentials/customize-with-hooks).
