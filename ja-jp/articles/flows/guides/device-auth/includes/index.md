::: note
This tutorial will help you call your own API from an input-constrained device using the Device Authorization Flow. If you want to learn how the flow works and why you should use it, see [Device Authorization Flow](/flows/concepts/device-auth).
:::

Auth0 makes it easy for your app to implement the Device Authorization flow using:

* Authentication API: Keep reading to learn how to call our API directly. For an interactive experience, see our [Device Flow Playground](https://auth0.github.io/device-flow-playground/).

## Prerequisites

**Before beginning this tutorial:**

* Check [limitations](#limitations) to be sure the Device Authorization flow is suitable for your implementation.

* [Register the Application with Auth0](/dashboard/guides/applications/register-app-native). 
  * Select an **Application Type** of **Native**.
  * If necessary, set **Allowed Web Origins**. You can use this to allow localhost as an origin for local development, or to set an allowed origin for specific TV software with architecture subject to CORS (eg: HTML5 + JS). Most applications will not use this setting.
  * Ensure that the **OIDC Conformant** toggle is enabled. This setting is in the [Dashboard](${manage_url}) under **Application Settings > Advanced > OAuth**.
  * Make sure the Application's **[Grant Types](/dashboard/guides/applications/update-grant-types)** include **Device Code**. This is also in the [Dashboard](${manage_url}), under **Application Settings > Advanced > Grant Types**.
  * If you want your Application to be able to use [Refresh Tokens](/tokens/concepts/refresh-tokens), make sure the Application's **[Grant Types](/dashboard/guides/applications/update-grant-types)** include **Refresh Token**.

* Set up and enable at least one connection for the Application: [Database connections](/dashboard/guides/connections/set-up-connections-database), [Social connections](/dashboard/guides/connections/set-up-connections-social)

* [Register your API with Auth0](/architecture-scenarios/mobile-api/part-2#create-the-api)
  * If you want your API to receive [Refresh Tokens](/tokens/concepts/refresh-tokens) to allow it to obtain new tokens when the previous ones expire, enable **Allow Offline Access**.

* [Configure Device User Code Settings](/dashboard/guides/tenants/configure-device-user-code-settings) to define the character set, format, and length of your randomly-generated user code.

## Steps

1. [Request device code](#request-device-code) (Device Flow): Request a device code that the user can use to authorize the device.
2. [Request device activation](#request-device-activation) (Device Flow): Request that the user authorize the device using their laptop or smartphone.
3. [Request Tokens](#request-tokens) (Device Flow): Poll the token endpoint to request a token.
4. [User authorization](#user-authorization) (Browser Flow): The user authorizes the device, so the device can receive tokens.
5. [Receive Tokens](#receive-tokens) (Device Flow): After the user successfully authorizes the device, receive tokens.
6. [Call your API](#call-your-api) (Device Flow): Use the retrieved Access Token to call your API.
7. [Refresh Tokens](#refresh-tokens) (Device Flow): Use a Refresh Token to request new tokens when the existing ones expire.
