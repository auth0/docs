::: warning
This feature uses delegation. By default, delegation is disabled for tenants without an add-on in use as of 8 June 2017. Legacy tenants who currently use an add-on that requires delegation may continue to use this feature. If delegation functionality is changed or removed from service at some point, customers who currently use it will be notified beforehand and given ample time to migrate. In addition, note that delegation does not support the use of custom domains so any features depending on it may not be fully functional alongside a custom domain.
