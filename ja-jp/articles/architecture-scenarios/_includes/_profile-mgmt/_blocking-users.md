[Blocking user access](/users/guides/block-and-unblock-users) in Auth0 provides a way to prevent user login to applications under certain conditions. By default, the Auth0 Dashboard provides an out-of-the-box mechanism to give administrators the ability to both block and unblock user access to all applications, and you can implement this functionality via use of the [Auth0 Management API](/api/management/v2#!/Users/patch_users_by_id). You can also use Auth0 extensibility to [disable user access to certain applications](/users/guides/manage-user-access-to-applications) as well as provide more fine-grained [access control](/architecture-scenarios/implementation/${platform}/${platform}-authorization).

In addition, the Auth0 Management API provides you with the ability to [unblock](/api/management/v2#!/User_Blocks/delete_user_blocks_by_id) users disabled due to excessive use of incorrect credentials.
