Your application may need to support a user’s request to remove their account (for example, you might need to meet [GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/) requirements). You can implement such a feature, along with a number of other profile-related functions, using the [Management API](/api/management/v2#!/Users). The Management API allows you to retrieve information stored about a user and update it as required.

Auth0 is capable of supporting various privacy-related requirements including the display of links to consent notices on signup and data protection to support the rights of users to view and correct data you’ve collected about them.

::: note
[GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/) and other privacy directives require that users have the right to view and correct data held about them. They also have the right to be “forgotten.” You can use the Management API to address these requirements and meet your legislative obligations.
