### Set up app in Twitter

Create a project and add a new app in the [Twitter Developer portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/). During this process, Twitter will generate an **API Key** and **API Secret Key** for your application; make note of these.

While setting up your app, use the following values:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Enable 3-legged OAuth | Toggle the switch to enable. | 
| Callback URLs | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Website URL | `https://${account.namespace}` |
| App permissions | Select the option that fitst your requirements. By default, your application will be granted **Read Only** permission. |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your callback URL would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
