### Set up your app in Twitter
Set up an app in Twitter. During this process, Twitter will generate a **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** for your application; make note of these.
1. Log in to [Twitter Developer App Management](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps), and click **Create an app**.
2. Complete information about your app including the following values:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| App URL | `https://${account.namespace}` |
| Redirect URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::::: note
If you're using a [custom domain](/custom-domains), you'll need to add that domain to a <dfn data-key="callback">callback URLs</dfn> whitelist for your [Twitter application](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps/create). For more information on this change, see this [Twitter developer forum post](https://twittercommunity.com/t/action-required-sign-in-with-twitter-users-must-whitelist-callback-urls/105342).

4. Ensure the **Enabled Sign in with Twitter** option is selected. 
5. Click **Create**, review the developer terms then **Create** again. Your **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** are displayed in the **Keys and tokens** tab of your app on Twitter.
::: panel Twitter Profile Attribute Permissions
Unlike many social identity providers, Twitter manages profile attribute permissions at the application level. By default, your application will be granted *Read* and *Write* permissions. You can customize these in the **Permissions** section of the [Twitter Developer App Management](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps) page. For more information, see: [Application Permission Model](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/application-permission-model).
