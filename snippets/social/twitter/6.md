## Access Twitter API

Once a user successfully authenticates, Twitter will include an <dfn data-key="access-token">Access Token</dfn> in the user profile it returns to Auth0. You can use this token to call Twitter's API.

To get the Twitter Access Token, you must retrieve the full user's profile using the Auth0 Management API and extract the Access Token from the response. For detailed steps, see [Call an Identity Provider's API](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/calling-an-external-idp-api).

Using the token, you can call Twitter's API following Twitter's documentation.

Optional: Get a <dfn data-key="refresh-token">[Refresh Token](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/guides/get-refresh-tokens)</dfn> from Twitter to refresh your Access Token once it expires. To ensure your application is secure, pay close attention to the [restrictions on using Refresh Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/concepts/refresh-tokens#restrictions-and-limitations).

::: note
Twitter allows you to use application-specific Access Tokens for many API calls without requiring user Access Tokens. When you create your app, a token is generated automatically and shown with the **API Key** and **API Secret Key** [Twitter Developer App Management](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps). Using application-specific Access Tokens will limit your app to requests that do not require user context. To learn more, see [Twitter Developer Documentation: Application-Only Authentication](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/overview/application-only.html).
