### User's email address is missing from retrieved user profile
Twitter connections do not retrieve the user's email address by default. But you can add a rule to request the email using the Access Token returned from Twitter *providing you supply a privacy policy and terms & conditions*.
Auth0 provides a rule template to get email addresses from Twitter. To use it, [create a new rule](${manage_url}/#/rules/create) with the **Get Email Address from Twitter** template under the **Enrich Profile** section.
If you are using Auth0 developer keys, this functionality will not work; you will need to use your Twitter Consumer Key and Consumer Secret.
You must also explicitly request permission to retrieve user email addresses for your Twitter app:
1. Login to [Twitter Developer App Management](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apps).
1. Choose your app.
1. Click **Edit**, then **Edit details** and enter the appropriate links in the **Terms of Service URL** and **Privacy Policy URL** fields.
1. Click **Save**.
1. Go to the **Permissions** tab and click **Edit**.
1. Select the **Request email address from users** option.
1. Click **Save**.
