### User's email address is missing from retrieved user profile

Twitter connections do not retrieve the user's email address by default. However, you can add a rule to request the email address using the Access Token returned from Twitter *providing you supply a privacy policy and terms & conditions*.

Auth0 provides a rule template to get email addresses from Twitter. To use it, [create a new rule](${manage_url}/#/rules/create) with the **Get Email Address from Twitter** template under the **Enrich Profile** section.

If you are using Auth0 developer keys, this functionality will not work; you will need to use your Twitter **API Key** and **API Secret Key**.

You must also explicitly request permission to retrieve user email addresses for your Twitter app:

1. Log in to [Twitter Developer Project and App Management](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/projects-and-apps).
2. Choose your project, and then your app settings.
3. Click **Edit** next to **Authentication settings**, then toggle the switch to enable **Request email address from users**.
4. Enter the appropriate links in the **Terms of service** and **Privacy policy** fields, then click **Save**.
