### Set up app in WordPress

Set up an app in the [WordPress Developer Portal](https://developer.wordpress.com/apps/). During this process, WordPress will generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your application; make note of these. (To find these, from the **My Applications** dashboard, locate your application and click **Manage Application**.)

While setting up your app, use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Website URL | `https://${account.namespace}` |
| Redirect URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Javascript Origins | `https://${account.namespace}/`|
| Type | Select **Web** as the client type|

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your redirect URL would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
