### Set up your app in LinkedIn
1. Log in to the [LinkedIn Developer portal](https://www.linkedin.com/developers), and click **Create App**.
2. Provide the information about your app.
3. Select the products you'd like to add/integrate into your app. By default, you'll get the abilities to **Share on LinkedIn** and **Sign In with LinkedIn**. You can, however, also use the **Marketing Developer Platform**.
4. Click **Create App**. LinkedIn generates a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your application. You can find these on the app's **Auth** screen under **Application credentials**. 
5. On the **Auth** screen under **OAuth 2.0 Settings**. Click the **pencil** icon, then click **Add redirect URL**. Enter the following redirect URL:
  `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::6. Click **Update** to save your changes.
