### Request that Evernote activate your API Key on production
When you [connected your app to Evernote Sandbox](/connections/social/evernote-sandbox), Evernote generated a **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** for you. You now need to request that Evernote activate your **Consumer Key** on production.
To do this, navigate to [Support Resources for Evernote Developers](https://dev.evernote.com/support/), click **Activate an API Key**, and enter the requested information.
