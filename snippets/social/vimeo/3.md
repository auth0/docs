### Set up app in Vimeo

Set up an app in the [Vimeo Developer Portal](https://developer.vimeo.com/apps/new) using Vimeo's [Register your app](https://developer.vimeo.com/api/guides/start#register-your-app) documentation. During this process, Vimeo will generate a **Client Identifier** and **Client Secret** for your application; make note of these.

While setting up your app, use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Callback URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your callback URL would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
