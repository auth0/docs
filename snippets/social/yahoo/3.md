### Set up app in Yahoo

Set up an app in Yahoo using Yahoo's [Getting Started: Create an Application and Get OAuth 2.0 Credentials](https://developer.yahoo.com/oauth2/guide/openid_connect/getting_started.html#getting-started-setup) documentation. During this process, Yahoo will generate a **Client ID* (Consumer Key)** and **Client Secret (Consumer Secret)** for your application; make note of these.

While setting up your app, use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Redirect URI | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| API Permissions | Select **OpenID Connect Permissions**, then at minimum, **Email** (to ensure that Yahoo returns the user's email address). |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
