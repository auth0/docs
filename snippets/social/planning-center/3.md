If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
