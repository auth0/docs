### Set up app in vKontakte
Set up an app in vKontakte. During this process, vKontakte will generate an **Application ID** and **Secure Key** for your application; make note of these.
1. Log in to [vKontakte Developers](https://new.vk.com/dev), go to **My Apps** and click **Create an Application**.
2. Select **Website** as the **Category**. 
3. Complete information about your app including the following values:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Site address | `https://${account.namespace}` |
| Base domain | `${account.namespace}` |
4. Click **Connect Site** to create the app. You will be required to confirm your request with a code send via SMS.
5. Once the application is created, select **Settings** in the left nav. In the **Authorized redirect URI** field, enter your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn>:
  `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::6. Click **Save**. The top of the page displays the **Application ID** and the **Secure Key**.
