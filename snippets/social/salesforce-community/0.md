# Connect Apps to Salesforce Community

The Salesforce Community social connection allows users to log in to your application using their Salesforce Community profile. Salesforce communities are branded spaces that allow employees, customers, and partners to connect. To learn more, see Salesforce's [Set Up and Manage Salesforce Communities](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=networks_overview.htm&type=5) documentation.

By default, Auth0 automatically syncs user profile data with each user login, thereby ensuring that changes made in the connection source are automatically updated in Auth0. Optionally, you can [disable user profile data synchronization](https://auth0.com/docs/users/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0) to allow for updating profile attributes from your application.
