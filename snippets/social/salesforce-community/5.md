### Create and enable connection in Auth0

[Set up the Salesforce Community social connection](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/guides/connections/set-up-connections-social) in Auth0. Make sure you have the generated **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**, and the Salesforce Community base path.

Besides the standard social connection settings, the Salesforce Community social connection configuration includes the following:

| Setting | Description | 
|---------|-------------|
| Community Base URL | Base path for the Salesforce Community. This is the section of the community's URL that follows the domain (example: https://{communitydomain}.force.com/{communitybasepath}). |
