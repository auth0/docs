### Find your Salesforce Community's base path
Salesforce Community base paths have the following format:
`https://{communitydomain}.force.com/{communitypath}`
For example, if the community name is `Trailblazers` and the community exists for customers, the base path would be `https://trailblazers.force.com/customers`.
