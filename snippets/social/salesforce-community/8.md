### Salesforce Community Authorization URL

When you authenticate users in a Salesforce Community, you use different endpoints than the regular Salesforce app. The authorization URL is the base path plus `/oauth2/authorize`. For example, if the community name is `Trailblazers` and the community exists for customers, the authorization URL would be:

```text
https://trailblazers.force.com/customers/oauth2/authorize?
response_type=token&
client_id=your_app_id&
redirect_uri=your_redirect_uri
```

You only need to configure the base path for the social connection because Auth0 automatically passes all required OAuth2 parameters (e.g., `response_type`, `client_id`) and concatenates other elements to the base path (i.e., `oauth2/authorize`).
