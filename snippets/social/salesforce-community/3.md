### Get Salesforce credentials
If you have already set up a [Salesforce Sandbox](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=deploy_sandboxes_intro.htm&type=5), set up your app in the Sandbox, and deployed the app to production, then you need to locate the app's production **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**.
Alternatively, if you are setting up a new app in production, you need to create an app in Salesforce and generate credentials for it, using [Salesforce's Create a Connected App](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=connected_app_create.htm&type=0) docs. During this process, Salesforce will generate a **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** for your application; make note of these.
While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| API (Enable OAuth Settings) | Click `Enable OAuth Settings` |
| Callback URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Selected OAuth Scopes | Add `Access your basic information` |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
