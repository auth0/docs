### Set up app in Slack

You'll need credentials to use Sign in with Slack. To retrieve your Client ID and secret, you'll need to [create a Slack App](https://api.slack.com/apps/new) if you haven't already.

Once your app is created, copy and paste the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** into the Auth0 configuration screen. Next, click on **OAuth & Permissions** in the Features menu on the left, and add `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` as a new **Redirect URL**

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
