# Connect Apps to PayPal

The PayPal social connection allows users to log in to your application using their PayPal profile.

By default, Auth0 automatically syncs user profile data with each user login, thereby ensuring that changes made in the connection source are automatically updated in Auth0. Optionally, you can [disable user profile data synchronization](https://auth0.com/docs/users/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0) to allow for updating profile attributes from your application.
