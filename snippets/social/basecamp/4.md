### Set up your app in Basecamp
Register an app in Basecamp and generate credentials for it through the [Basecamp Launchpad](https://integrate.37signals.com/). While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Redirect URI | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Products | Select the Basecamp products with which you want your app to integrate. |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::During this process, Basecamp will generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your application, which you can see on the Application Details page; make note of these.
