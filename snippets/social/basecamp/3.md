### Set up app in Basecamp

Register an app in Basecamp and generate credentials for it in the [Basecamp Launchpad](https://integrate.37signals.com/). During this process, Basecamp will generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your application, which you can see on the Application Details page; make note of these.

While setting up your app, use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Redirect URI | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Products | Select the Basecamp products with which you want your app to integrate. |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
