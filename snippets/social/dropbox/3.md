### Set up app in Dropbox
Set up an app in Dropbox using Dropbox's [App Console: Creating a Dropbox App](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/getting-started#app%20console) doc. During this process, Dropbox will generate an **App key** and **App secret** for your application; make note of these.
While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Choose an API | **Dropbox API**. |
| Choose the type of access you need | Appropriate options depending on your needs. |
| App name | Your application name. |
| Redirect URIs | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
