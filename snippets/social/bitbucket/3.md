### Set up your app in Bitbucket
Set up an app in Bitbucket using Atlassian's [OAuth on Bitbucket Cloud: Create a consumer](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/oauth-on-bitbucket-cloud-238027431.html#OAuthonBitbucketCloud-Createaconsumer) doc. During this process, Bitbucket will generate a **Key** and **Secret** for your application; make note of these.
While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Callback URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Permissions | Select the permissions you want to enable for this connection. At minimum, you need `account:email` and `account:read`. |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
