### Set up app in Yammer
Set up an app in Yammer. During this process, Yammer will generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your application; make note of these.
1. Log in to [Yammer Developer Center](https://developer.yammer.com/) and click on **Apps** in the top menu.
2. Click on **Register an App**.
3. Then click **Register New App**.
4. Name your app and complete the form. For the **Redirect URI**, enter your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn>:
  `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::5. Click **Continue**. Once your app is created, your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** will be displayed.
