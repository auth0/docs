### Set up app in Microsoft Account
1. Follow the instructions in [Quickstart: Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform (Preview)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-register-app).
2. While setting up your app, when asked to set a **Redirect URI**, enter your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn>:
  `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::Microsoft will generate an **Application (client) ID** for your application. You can find this on the app's **Overview** screen.
