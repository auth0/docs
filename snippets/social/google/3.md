### Create Google credentials

Configure your OAuth consent screen and create credentials in the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials) using Google's [Setting up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849) documentation. During this process, Google will generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your application; make note of these.

While setting up your OAuth consent screen, use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| User Type | Select **External**. |
| Application Type | Select **Public**. |
| Authorized domains | `auth0.com` |

::: warning
If your application requests sensitive OAuth scopes or uses a custom image, [Google will limit it to 100 logins until the OAuth consent screen is verified](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/client-verification). Verification can take several days. To learn more about sensitive scopes, see Google's [OAuth 2.0 Scopes for Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/scopes) documentation. To pass verification you will need to prove ownership of all Authorized domains you specify on Google's OAuth consent screen. If you're using custom domains, use your custom domain instead of `auth0.com`.

While setting up your credentials, use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Application type | Web application |
| Authorized JavaScript origins | `https://${account.namespace}` |
| Authorized redirect URIs | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
