### Set up app in Stripe Connect

Configure Connect settings in the [Stripe Developer Dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/applications). During this process, Stripe Connect will generate a **Client ID**; make note of this. Also make note of your **Secret API key**, which can be found on [Dashboard Home](https://dashboard.stripe.com/dashboard).

While configuring Connect, use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Redirect URI | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
