### Set up app in Docomo

Set up an app following the steps on the [dAccount Connect Page](https://id.smt.docomo.ne.jp/src/dlogin/ctop_method.html).

While setting up your app, use the following settings: 

| Field | Value to enter |
--------|----------------|
| Service name (サービス名) | Application name. |
| Service overview (サービス概要) | Brief description of your application. |
| Access Token lifetime (アクセストークン有効期間 秒) | Lifetime of your Access Token in seconds. |
| Redirect URI (リダイレクトURI) | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Available scopes (利用可能スコープ) | <dfn data-key="scope">Scopes</dfn> for the information you are requesting for your app. |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
