### Set up your app in Baidu
1. Log into the [integration portal](https://developer.baidu.com/dev) and register a new app. During this process, Baidu will generate an **API Key** and **Secret Key** for your application; make note of these.
While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| <dfn data-key="callback">Callback URL</dfn> | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::2. Select your application on the console, and then click on `API 管理 -> 安全设置`
