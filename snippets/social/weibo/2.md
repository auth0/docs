### Set up your app in Weibo
Set up an app in Weibo. During this process, Weibo will generate an **appkey** and **appkey secret** for your application; make note of these.
1. Register your app with [Weibo](https://open.weibo.com/authentication).
2. Provide a <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn> during the registration process:
  `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::After the registration process, Weibo provides you with an **appkey** and a corresponding **appkey secret**.
