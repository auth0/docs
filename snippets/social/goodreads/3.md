1. Log in to the [Goodreads developer portal](https://www.goodreads.com/api) and select *developer key*.
2. Complete the form then click **Apply for a Developer Key**. 
3. Enter your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn> in the `Callback URL` field:
  `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::Once the application is registered, the **Key** and **Secret** for your new app will be displayed.
