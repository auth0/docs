### Set up app in Goodreads

Request Goodreads credentials by logging in to the [Goodreads Developer portal](https://www.goodreads.com/api), clicking **Developer Key**, and entering the required information. During this process, Goodreads will generate a **Key** and **Secret** for you; make note of these.

While setting up your app, use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Callback URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your callback URL would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
