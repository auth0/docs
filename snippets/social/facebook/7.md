## Facebook re-authentication

Once users authenticate, they will be prompted to accept the permissions your app has requested. Once they authenticate and accept, they will not be expected to re-authenticate unless you force them to. To learn how to force re-authentication, see Facebook's [Re-Authentication](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/reauthentication) documentation.
