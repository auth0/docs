### Test connection
You're ready to [test your connection](/dashboard/guides/connections/test-connections-social). After logging in, you'll be prompted to allow your app access. To do so, click **Install unlisted app**.
::: note
Facebook allows you to create a copy of your application to use for testing purposes. A test application has its own unique **App ID** and **App Secret**. Because Auth0 only allows one Facebook connection to be configured per tenant, you have two options for testing in Auth0:
* While testing, use the testing application's **App ID** and **App Secret** in Auth0's social connection, and then change these values when you are ready to connect to the production application.
* [Create another Auth0 tenant](/dashboard/guides/tenants/create-multiple-tenants) to use for testing purposes and [set up a test environment](/dev-lifecycle/setting-up-env#set-the-environment).
