## Access Facebook's API

Once a user successfully authenticates, Facebook will include an <dfn data-key="access-token">Access Token</dfn> in the user profile it returns to Auth0. You can use this token to call Facebook's API.

To get the Facebook Access Token, you must retrieve the full user's profile using the Auth0 Management API and extract the Access Token from the response. For detailed steps, see [Call an Identity Provider's API](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/calling-an-external-idp-api).

Using the token, you can call Facebook's API following Facebook's documentation.

Optional: Get a <dfn data-key="refresh-token">[Refresh Token](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/guides/get-refresh-tokens)</dfn> from Facebook to refresh your Access Token once it expires. To ensure your application is secure, pay close attention to the [restrictions on using Refresh Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/concepts/refresh-tokens#restrictions-and-limitations).

Facebook lets you select the minimum version of the Facebook API that is available to the application. This can be changed in the in the 'Settings/Advanced' section of your application in the Facebook developer portal. 

Auth0 has been tested with version 3.2. We recommend setting that as the minimum version, but it could work with newer versions.
