### Set up app in Facebook
1. Log in to the [Facebook Developer](https://developers.facebook.com/) portal. 
2. Follow steps for [App Development](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps#register) to register your app. 
3. Add Facebook Login to your app in the App Dashboard. When asked to select a scenario, choose **Facebook Login**.
4. On the **Facebook Login > Settings** page, under **Valid Oauth Redirect URIs**, enter your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn>:
  `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`
  You can also set a **Deauthorize Callback URL** that will be called when a user deauthorizes your app.
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::::: note
If your application requests sensitive permissions, it may be [subject to review by Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/). Only the `default` and `email` permissions do not currently require app review. For info on Facebook permissions, see Facebook's [Facebook Login Permissions Reference](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/permissions/).
:::
Once you are done you should have two pieces of information: the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your app.
