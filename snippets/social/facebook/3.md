### Set up app in Facebook

Create an app in the [Facebook Developer portal](https://developers.facebook.com/), and add **Facebook Login** to the app as a **Product**. During this process, Facebook will generate a **App ID** and **App Secret** for your application; make note of these.

While setting up your app, use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| How are you using your app? | Select **For everything else**. |
| Permissions and Features | Select the permissions your app will require. Only the `default` and `email` permissions do not require app review by Facebook. |

While setting up the Facebook Login product, use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Client OAuth Settings | Enable **Web OAuth Login** (web applications) or **Client OAuth Login** (native applications), depending on your app type. |
| Valid OAuth Redirect URIs | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Deauthorize Callback URL | Enter the URL you would like Facebook to call when a user does not consent to your app. |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
