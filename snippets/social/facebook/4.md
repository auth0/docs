### Create and enable connection in Auth0

[Set up the Facebook social connection](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/guides/connections/set-up-connections-social) in Auth0. Make sure you have the generated **App ID** and the **App Secret**.

Besides the standard social connection settings, the Facebook social connection configuration includes the following:

| Setting | Description | 
|---------|-------------|
| User Data | Attributes of the Facebook user profile. |

::: note
Facebook allows you to create a copy of your application to use for testing purposes. A test application has its own unique **App ID** and **App Secret**. Because Auth0 only allows one Facebook connection to be configured per tenant, you have two options while testing in Auth0:

* Use the testing application's **App ID** and **App Secret** in Auth0's social connection, and then change these values when you are ready to connect to the production application.
* [Create another Auth0 tenant](https://auth0.com/docs/dashboard/guides/tenants/create-multiple-tenants) to use for testing purposes and [set up a test environment](https://auth0.com/docs/dev-lifecycle/setting-up-env#set-the-environment).
