# Authenticate using OpenIDConnect to another Auth0 Tenant (Deprecated)
::: warning
This solution has been deprecated because it requires the use of a legacy version of the Auth0 User Profile. You should use the [OIDC Enterprise Connection](/connections/enterprise/oidc) instead.
:::

You can use an application on one Auth0 tenant (referred to below as the **OIDC Provider tenant**) as an identity provider in another Auth0 tenant (the **Relying Party tenant**).
