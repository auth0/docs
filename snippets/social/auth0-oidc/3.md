## Use the Auth0 connection

You can use any of the standard Auth0 mechanisms (such as direct links, <dfn data-key="lock">[Auth0 Lock](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock)</dfn>, [auth0.js](https://auth0.com/docs/auth0js), and so on) to log in a user with the auth0-oidc connection.

A direct link would look like:

```text
https://${account.namespace}/authorize/?client_id=${account.clientId}&response_type=code&redirect_uri=${account.callback}&state=OPAQUE_VALUE&connection=YOUR-AUTH0-CONNECTION-NAME
```

To add a custom connection in Lock, you can add a custom button as described in [Adding a new UI element using JavaScript](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries/lock/v9/ui-customization#adding-a-new-ui-element-using-javascript) and use the direct link as the button `href`.

The user will be redirected to the built-in login page of the OIDC Provider Auth0 tenant where they can choose their identity provider (from the enabled connections of the target Application) and enter their credentials.
