## Configure the OIDC Provider Auth0 Tenant

1. Create an Application or edit an existing one. Set the application type to **Regular Web App**.
2. Take note of your application's **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. You will need these to create the connection in the Relying Party tenant.
3. Add the Relying Party tenant's login <dfn data-key="callback">callback</dfn> to the list of **Allowed Callback URLs**: `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.

4. Make sure that the **OIDC-Conformant** toggle in the **OAuth** tab under the application's **Advance Settings** is turned **off**.
5. Make sure that the tenant has the **Legacy User Profile** toggle enabled under the **Migrations** section of the [Tenant Advanced Settings](${manage_url}/#/tenant/advanced). If you don't see this toggle for your tenant, please open a support case to request this feature to be enabled.
