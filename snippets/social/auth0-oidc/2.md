## Configure the Relying Party Auth0 Tenant

The Auth0-to-Auth0 connection is not yet supported in the Dashboard. You need to create the connection using the [Create a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/api/v2#!/Connections/post_connections) endpoint, which will require an [Management API V2 token](https://auth0.com/docs/api/management/v2/tokens) with `create:connections` <dfn data-key="scope">scope</dfn>.

Here is a sample request:

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H 'Authorization: Bearer {YOUR_API_V2_TOKEN}' -d @auth0-oidc-connection.json https://${account.namespace}/api/v2/connections
```

with the **auth0-oidc-connection.json** file containing:

```js
{
  "name": "YOUR-AUTH0-CONNECTION-NAME",
  "strategy": "auth0-oidc",
  "options": {
    "client_id": "OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID",
    "client_secret": "OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "domain": "OIDC_PROVIDER_AUTH0_DOMAIN",
    "scope": "openid"
  },
  "enabled_clients":["${account.clientId}"]
}
```

The required parameters for this connection are:

| Parameter | Description |
| - | - |
| **name** | How the connection will be referenced in Auth0 or in your app |
| **strategy** | Defines the protocol implemented by the provider. This should always be `auth0-oidc` |
| **options.client_id** | The `clientID` of the target Application in the OIDC Provider Auth0 tenant |
| **options.client_secret** | The `clientSecret` of the target Application in the OIDC Provider Auth0 tenant |
| **options.domain** | The domain of the OIDC Provider Auth0 tenant |
| **options.scope** <br/><span class="label label-primary">Optional</span> | The scope parameters for which you wish to request consent (such as `profile`, `identities`, and so on) |
| **enabled_clients** <br/><span class="label label-primary">Optional</span> | An array containing the identifiers of the applications for which the connection is to be enabled. If the array is empty or the property is not specified, no applications are enabled |
