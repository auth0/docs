### Set up app in Box
Set up an app in Box using Box's [Custom Apps: Setup with OAuth 2.0](https://developer.box.com/guides/applications/custom-apps/oauth2-setup/) doc. During this process, Box will generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your application; make note of these.
While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Redirect URI | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Application Scopes | Select the permissions you want to enable for this connection. |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
