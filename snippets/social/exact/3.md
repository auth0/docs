### Set up your app in Exact
Set up an app in Exact using Exact's [Register a new app](https://support.exactonline.com/community/s/article/All-All-HNO-Tutorial-resources-eol-files-hlp-eol-app-center---user-eol-appcenter-user-registerapikey-u?language=en_GB) knowledge base article. You will need to log in to see this documentation. During this process, Exact will generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for your application; make note of these.
You can register applications in multiple regions with Exact. By default, Auth0 will use `https://start.exactonline.nl`, but this value can be overridden with the `Base URL` parameter.
While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Callback URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
