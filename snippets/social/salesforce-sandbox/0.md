# Connect Apps to Salesforce Sandbox

The Salesforce Sandbox social connection allows users to log in to your application using their Salesforce Sandbox profile, which is a separate instance of the Salesforce service, designed to allow you to isolate customization and development work from your production environment until youâ€™re ready to deploy changes. To learn more, see Salesforce's [Sandboxes: Staging Environments for Customizing and Testing](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=deploy_sandboxes_intro.htm&type=5) documentation.

By default, Auth0 automatically syncs user profile data with each user login, thereby ensuring that changes made in the connection source are automatically updated in Auth0. Optionally, you can [disable user profile data synchronization](https://auth0.com/docs/users/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0) to allow for updating profile attributes from your application.
