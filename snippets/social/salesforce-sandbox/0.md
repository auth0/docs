# Connect Apps to Salesforce Sandbox
In addition to its production system, Salesforce offers sandboxes, so you can isolate customization and development work from your production environment until youâ€™re ready to deploy changes. This guide will show you how to add functionality to your web app that allows your users to log in with Salesforce Sandbox.
To learn more about Salesforce Sandboxes, see Salesforce's [Sandboxes: Staging Environments for Customizing and Testing](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=deploy_sandboxes_intro.htm&type=5) docs.
