# Connect Apps to Fitbit

The Fitbit social connection allows users to log in to your application using their Fitbit profile.

By default, Auth0 automatically syncs user profile data with each user login, thereby ensuring that changes made in the connection source are automatically updated in Auth0. Optionally, you can [disable user profile data synchronization](https://auth0.com/docs/users/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0) to allow for updating profile attributes from your application.

::: note
New connections with Fitbit will use OAuth 2.0. Please see the following documentation on [Using OAuth 2.0](https://dev.fitbit.com/docs/oauth2/) with Fitbit.
