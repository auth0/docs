### Set up your app in Fitbit
Set up an app in Fitbit. During this process, Fitbit will generate a **API Key** and **API Secret** for your application; make note of these.
1. Log in to [Fitbit's Developer](https://dev.fitbit.com) portal, and select **Register an App**.
2. Complete information about your app including the following:
| Field | Description
--------|------------
Application Website | `https://${account.namespace}`
OAuth 2.0 Application Type | Select **Application**
Callback URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`
Default Access Type | The type of access granted to the app
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::3. Click **Register**.
