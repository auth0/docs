### Set up app in Fitbit

Set up an app in the [Fitbit Developer portal](https://dev.fitbit.com). During this process, Fitbit will generate a **API Key** and **API Secret** for your application; make note of these.

While setting up your app, use the following settings:

| Field  | Description |
| - | - |
| Application Website | `https://${account.namespace}` |
| OAuth 2.0 Application Type | Select **Application** |
| Callback URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Default Access Type | The type of access granted to the app. |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your callback URL would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
