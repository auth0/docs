### Set up channel in LINE

Set up a provider and channel using LINE's [Create a Channel](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/liff/getting-started/) documentation, then apply for email permissions using LINE'S [Integrating LINE Login with your web app: Applying for email permission](https://developers.line.biz/en/docs/line-login/integrate-line-login/#applying-for-email-permission) section. During this process, LINE will generate a **Channel ID** and **Channel Secret** for your application; make note of these.

While setting up your channel, use the following values:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Application type | Enable **Web app**. |
| Callback URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your callback URL would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
