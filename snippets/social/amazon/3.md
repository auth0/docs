### Set up app on Amazon

Register an app in the [Amazon Developer Portal](https://developer.amazon.com/) using Amazon's [Register for Login with Amazon](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/login-with-amazon/register-web.html) documentation. During this process, Amazon will generate a **API key** and **API secret key** for your application; make note of these.  After your application is created, you can find these on its **Application Details** view.

When setting up your app, use the following values:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Allowed Javascript Origins | `https://${account.namespace}/` |
| Allowed Return URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your return URL would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
