### Set up your app in RenRen
Set up an app in RenRen. During this process, RenRen will generate an **API Key** and **Secret Key** for your application; make note of these.
1. Log in to the [RenRen Integration portal](http://app.renren.com/developers), and click **Create New App**.
2. Complete the form and enter your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn> for the **callback URL**:
  `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback`
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
:::3. Click **Create App**. The `API Key` and `Secret Key` are displayed.
