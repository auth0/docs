### Set up app in Shopify
Set up an app in Dwolla using the instructions in Shopify's [Public Apps](https://help.shopify.com/en/api/getting-started/authentication/public-authentication#generate-credentials-from-your-partner-dashboard) doc. During this process, Shopify will generate an **API key** and **API secret key** for your application; make note of these.
While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| App URL | `https://${account.namespace}` |
| Whitelisted redirection URL(s) | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
