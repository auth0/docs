# Connect Web Apps to Apple
You can add functionality to your web application that allows your users to log in with Apple. The [Apple App Store Developer Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#sign-in-with-apple) require that Sign In With Apple (SIWA) must be available in all applications that exclusively use third-party sign-in options, such as Facebook or Google.
::: note
To add SIWA capabilities to your native app, see [Add Sign In with Apple to Native iOS Apps](/connections/nativesocial/apple).
