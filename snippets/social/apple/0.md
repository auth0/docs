# Connect Web Apps to Apple
 
The Apple social connection allows users to log in to your application using their Apple profile. The [Apple App Store Developer Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#sign-in-with-apple) require that Sign In With Apple (SIWA) must be available in all applications that exclusively use third-party sign-in options, such as Facebook or Google.

By default, Auth0 automatically syncs user profile data with each user login, thereby ensuring that changes made in the connection source are automatically updated in Auth0. Optionally, you can [disable user profile data synchronization](https://auth0.com/docs/users/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0) to allow for updating profile attributes from your application.

::: note
Apple does not currently provide a way to change the icon/logo displayed on the Apple login page.
