## Set up app in Apple

Set up an app in the [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com) using Apple's [Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/get-started/) documentation. During this process, Apple will generate the following IDs and keys for your application; make note of these:

* Services ID (Client ID)
* Client Secret Signing Key 
* Apple Team ID
* Key ID

When setting up your app, use the following values:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Bundle ID | `com.auth0` |
| Services ID Identifier | Reverse domain name (e.g., `.com.auth0.travel0`) |
| Web Domain | `https://${account.namespace}/` |
| Return URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your callback URL would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">callback URL</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
