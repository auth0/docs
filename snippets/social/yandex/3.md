### Set up app in Yandex
Set up an app in [Yandex](https://oauth.yandex.ru/client/new) using Yandex's [Application Registration](https://yandex.ru/dev/oauth/doc/dg/tasks/register-client-docpage/) doc. During this process, Yandex will generate an **Application ID** and **Application Password** for your application; make note of these.
While setting up your app, make sure you use the following settings:
| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Callback URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Scopes | Select the appropriate options depending on your application's needs. |
::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name for redirects
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, plus `.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com` and your redirect URI would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com/login/callback`.

If you are using [custom domains](/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
