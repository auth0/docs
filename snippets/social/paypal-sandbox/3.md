### Set up app in PayPal Sandbox

Create an app in PayPal Sandbox and generate credentials for it, using PayPal's [Get Credentials](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api/overview/#get-credentials) documentation. During this process, PayPal will generate a **Client ID** and **Secret** for your application; make note of these.

While setting up your app, use the following settings:

| Field | Value to Provide |
| - | - |
| Return URL | `https://${account.namespace}/login/callback` |
| Log In with PayPal | Enable, then under **Advanced Options**, select **Full Name**, **Date of Birth**, **Timezone**, **Locale**, and **Language**. |

::: panel Find your Auth0 domain name
If your Auth0 domain name is not shown above and you are not using our custom domains feature, your domain name is your tenant name, your regional subdomain (unless your tenant is in the US region and was created before June 2020), plus`.auth0.com`. For example, if your tenant name were `exampleco-enterprises`, your Auth0 domain name would be `exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com` and your return URL would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.us.auth0.com/login/callback`. (If your tenant is in the US and was created before June 2020, then your domain name would be `https://exampleco-enterprises.auth0.com`.)

If you are using [custom domains](https://auth0.com/docs/custom-domains), your <dfn data-key="callback">redirect URI</dfn> will have the following format: `https://<YOUR CUSTOM DOMAIN>/login/callback`.
