# Connect Apps to PayPal Sandbox

The PayPal Sandbox social connection allows users to log in to your application using their PayPal Sandbox profile, which is a separate instance of the PayPal service, designed to allow you to isolate customization and development work from your production environment until you’re ready to deploy changes. To learn more, see the [PayPal Sandbox Testing Guide](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api-basics/sandbox/).

By default, Auth0 automatically syncs user profile data with each user login, thereby ensuring that changes made in the connection source are automatically updated in Auth0. Optionally, you can [disable user profile data synchronization](https://auth0.com/docs/users/configure-connection-sync-with-auth0) to allow for updating profile attributes from your application.
