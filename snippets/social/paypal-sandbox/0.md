# Connect Apps to PayPal Sandbox
In addition to its production system, PayPal offers sandboxes, so you can isolate customization and development work from your production environment until youâ€™re ready to deploy changes. This guide will show you how to add functionality to your web app that allows your users to log in with PayPal Sandbox.
To learn more about PayPal Sandboxes, see the [PayPal Sandbox Testing Guide](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api-basics/sandbox/).
