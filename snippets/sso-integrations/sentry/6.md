#### Sentry SSO integration

Before you continue, make sure you have your SSO integration Client ID. You will use the Client ID to replace the `SSO_CLIENT_ID` placeholders.

1. Login to your Sentry organization's **Auth settings** page as an admin.

2. Select **Configure** for the **Auth0** provider.

3. Enter the **Metadata URL** (be sure to replace the SSO_CLIENT_ID placeholder with the Client ID of your SSO Integration):
`https://${account.namespace}/samlp/metadata/SSO_CLIENT_ID`
