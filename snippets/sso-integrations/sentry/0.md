# Configure SSO Integration for Sentry

The Sentry Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Sentry. Your users log in to Sentry with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.

To learn more, read [Single Sign-On Integrations](https://auth0.com/docs/sso). If you need details about other integrations, review [Connections](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders).
