#### Concur SSO integration

Before you continue, make sure you have your SSO integration Client ID. You will use the Client ID to replace the `SSO_CLIENT_ID` placeholders.

Concur requires you to contact their support team to setup SSO through SAML. [Download your Auth0 signing certificate](https://${account.namespace}/pem), and provide it to Concur.

Once configured on their side, you can use any of the links below for SSO (be sure to replace the SSO_CLIENT_ID placeholder with the Client ID of your SSO Integration):
`https://${account.namespace}/samlp/SSO_CLIENT_ID`

Alternatively, to log in with a specific identity provider, you can add a `connection` parameter (be sure to replace the SSO_CLIENT_ID placeholder with the Client ID of your SSO Integration):

```text
https://${account.namespace}/samlp/SSO_CLIENT_ID?connection=google-oauth2
https://${account.namespace}/samlp/SSO_CLIENT_ID?connection=Username-Password-Authentication
```

In this case, Auth0 will redirect users to the specified connection and will not display the Login widget. Make sure you send the SAMLRequest using `HTTP POST`.

:::note 
Notice that Concur only supports IdP-Initiated SSO, so you must use any of the links above to initiate SSO.

Optionally, you can specify a Logout URL:
`https://${account.namespace}/logout`
