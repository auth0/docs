# Configure SSO Integration for Tableau Online

The Tableau Online Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Tableau Online. Your users log in to Tableau Online with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
