#### SharePoint SSO integration

Before you continue, make sure you have your SSO integration Client ID. You will use the Client ID to replace the `SSO_CLIENT_ID` placeholders.

![Locate Client ID](https://auth0.com/docs/media/articles/dashboard/sso-integrations/dashboard-integrations-sso-create_view-tutorial.png)

1. Open a SharePoint Powershell session, and install the Auth0 PowerShell Module:
`iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString("https://cdn.auth0.com/sharepoint/install.ps1"))`

2. Enable Auth0 for the SharePoint application by running the following PowerShell command (be sure to replace the SSO_CLIENT_ID placeholder with the Client ID of your SSO Integration and the SHAREPOINT_URL placeholder with the SharePoint URL you configured earlier in this process):
```text
Enable-Auth0 -auth0Domain:"${account.namespace}" -clientId:"SSO_CLIENT_ID" -webAppUrl:"SHAREPOINT_URL" -identifierClaimType:"http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress" -claims:@("Email|http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress", "Client ID|http://schemas.auth0.com/clientID", "Given Name|http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname", "Surname|http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname", "Picture|http://schemas.auth0.com/picture") -allowWindowsAuth'
```

:::note
You can change the claim used to identify the user by modifying the `identifierClaimType` parameter. Also, you can map other claims by changing the `claims` parameter.
:::

3. Enable the custom claims provider:
`Enable-ClaimsProvider`

4. Go to **SharePoint Central Admin** > **Security**.

5. Under the **General Security** section, click **Configure Auth0 Claims Provider**, and set the required configuration parameters:

    * **Domain**:
    `${account.namespace}`
    
    * **Client ID**:
    SSO_CLIENT_ID

    * **Client Secret**:
    SSO_CLIENT_SECRET
    
    * **Identifier User Field**: Specify the property name that will be used to identify the user in the People Picker. By default, we use `Email`. You can see the list of the possible properties at the [User](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.net/blob/master/src/Auth0.ManagementApi/Models/User.cs#L13) and [UserBase](https://github.com/auth0/auth0.net/blob/master/src/Auth0.ManagementApi/Models/UserBase.cs) models.

::: note
These fields are multi-line fields, allowing you to specify multiple combinations of Domain/Client ID/Client Secret when you want to configure different SharePoint Web Applications with Auth0.

6. Browse the app.

The module uses the SharePoint PowerShell Cmdlets to configure SharePoint. Here is the [source code](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-sharepoint/tree/master/auth0-authentication-provider).

* **Update**: To update an existing installation to the latest version of the claims provider, you can run `Update-ClaimsProvider`.
* **Remove**: If you want to remove Auth0 from the web application, run `Disable-Auth0 SHAREPOINT_URL`. Be sure to replace the SHAREPOINT_URL placeholder with ythe SharePoint URL you configured earlier in this process. After that, you can also remove the claims provider by running `Disable-ClaimsProvider`.
* **Troubleshoot**: To troubleshoot any issues with authentication or the Claims Provider, you can run `Troubleshoot-Auth0` and open a ticket in our [Support Center](${env.DOMAIN_URL_SUPPORT}) to get help. (Available to customers with an active support plan. See [Auth0â€™s Support Policy](https://auth0.com/docs/support) for other options.)
