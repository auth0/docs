# Configure SSO Integration for Pluralsight

The Pluralsight Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Pluralsight. Your users log in to Pluralsight with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.

To learn more, read [Single Sign-On Integrations](https://auth0.com/docs/sso). If you need details about other integrations, review [Connections](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders).
