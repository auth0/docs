# Configure SSO Integration for Adobe Sign

The Adobe Sign Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Adobe Sign. Your users log in to Adobe Sign with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
