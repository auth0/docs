# Configure SSO Integration for Adobe Sign

The Adobe Sign [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Adobe Sign. Your users log in to Adobe Sign with Auth0 [identity providers](/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
