#### Box SSO integration

::: warning
The following steps only work for [Box Enterprise accounts](https://www.box.com/).
:::

Before you continue, make sure you have your SSO integration Client ID. You will use the Client ID to replace the `SSO_CLIENT_ID` placeholders.

Configuring SAML SSO with Box requires you to call their support team. They will ask for a few pieces of information:

1. [Your Auth0 signing certificate](https://${account.namespace}/pem).

2. The **EntityID**: `urn:${account.namespace}`.

3. The identifier that maps to Box usernames. By default we use the `emailaddress` claim:
`http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress`

4. The **Redirect URL**, which is the login endpoint in Auth0 (be sure to replace the SSO_CLIENT_ID placeholder with the Client ID of your SSO Integration):
`https://${account.namespace}/samlp/SSO_CLIENT_ID`

5. OPTIONAL: If you would like your Box user accounts to be created automatically, request that the Box support team enable automatic account provisioning for your account. To do so, you will need to provide the claims that we use for first name and last name. By default, we use `givenname` as the first name and `surname` as the last name.
