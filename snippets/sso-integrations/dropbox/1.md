## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

* Sign up for a [Dropbox Business account](https://www.dropbox.com/business).
* [Set up a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), which is a source of users. Connections can be databases, social identity providers, or enterprise identity providers, and can be shared among different applications. You may set up more than one connection for use with SSO integrations.
