# Configure SSO Integration for Sprout Video

The Sprout Video Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Sprout Video. Your users log in to Sprout Video with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
