# Configure SSO Integration for Hosted Graphite

The Hosted Graphite Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Hosted Graphite. Your users log in to Hosted Graphite with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.

To learn more, read [Single Sign-On Integrations](https://auth0.com/docs/sso). If you need details about other integrations, review [Connections](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders).
