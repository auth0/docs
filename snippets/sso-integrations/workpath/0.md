# Configure SSO Integration for Workpath

The Workpath Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Workpath. Your users log in to Workpath with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
