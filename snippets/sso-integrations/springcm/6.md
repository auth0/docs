#### SpringCM SSO integration

Before you continue, make sure you have your SSO integration Client ID. You will use the Client ID to replace the `SSO_CLIENT_ID` placeholders.

![Locate Client ID](https://auth0.com/docs/media/articles/dashboard/sso-integrations/dashboard-integrations-sso-create_view-tutorial.png)

1. Log in to SpringCM as an admin.

2. Select the **SAML SSO** menu under **Account Preferences**.

3. Enter the **Issuer**:
`urn:${account.namespace}`

4. Enter the **Service Provider (SP) Initiated Endpoint** (be sure to replace the SSO_CLIENT_ID placeholder with the Client ID of your SSO Integration):
`https://${account.namespace}/samlp/SSO_CLIENT_ID`

Alternatively, to log in with a specific identity provider, you can add a `connection` parameter (be sure to replace the SSO_CLIENT_ID placeholder with the Client ID of your SSO Integration):
```text
https://${account.namespace}/samlp/SSO_CLIENT_ID?connection=email
https://${account.namespace}/samlp/SSO_CLIENT_ID?connection=google-oauth2
https://${account.namespace}/samlp/SSO_CLIENT_ID?connection=Username-Password-Authentication
```

In this case, Auth0 will redirect users to the specified connection and will not display the Login widget. Make sure you send the SAMLRequest using `HTTP POST`.

5. [Download your Auth0 signing certificate](https://${account.namespace}/pem), and upload it to SpringCM. Then select the uploaded file as the **Issuing Certificate**.
