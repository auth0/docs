# Configure SSO Integration for SpringCM

The SpringCM Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for SpringCM. Your users log in to SpringCM with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
