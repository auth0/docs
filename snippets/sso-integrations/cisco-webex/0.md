# Configure SSO Integration for Cisco WebEx

The Cisco WebEx Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Cisco WebEx. Your users log in to Cisco WebEx with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
