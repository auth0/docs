# Configure SSO Integration for Cisco WebEx

The Cisco WebEx [Single Sign-on (SSO)](https://auth0.com/docs/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Cisco WebEx. Your users log in to Cisco WebEx with Auth0 [identity providers](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
