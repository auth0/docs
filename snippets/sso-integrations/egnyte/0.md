# Configure SSO Integration for Egnyte

The Egnyte Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Egnyte. Your users log in to Egnyte with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
