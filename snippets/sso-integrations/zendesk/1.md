## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

* Sign up for a Zendesk account.
* [Set up a connection](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), which is a source of users. Connections can be databases, social identity providers, or enterprise identity providers, and can be shared among different applications. You may set up more than one connection for use with SSO integrations.

::: warning
Zendesk **requires** that all users have an email address. When enabling enterprise or social connections, make sure that they will provide an email address that can be sent to Zendesk.
