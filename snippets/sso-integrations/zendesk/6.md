#### Zendesk SSO integration

:::note
This integration uses SAML, which works with only [certain versions of Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663826-SSO-single-sign-on-options-in-Zendesk).
:::

Before you continue, make sure you have your SSO integration Client ID. You will use the Client ID to replace the `SSO_CLIENT_ID` placeholders.

![Locate Client ID](https://auth0.com/docs/media/articles/dashboard/sso-integrations/dashboard-integrations-sso-create_view-tutorial.png)

1. Log in to Zendesk as an administrator.

2. Go to **Security** > **Single sign-on**.

3. For **SAML**, select **Configure**.

4. Select the **Enabled** checkbox.

5. Enter the **SAML SSO URL** (be sure to replace the SSO_CLIENT_ID placeholder with the Client ID of your SSO Integration):
`https://${account.namespace}/samlp/SSO_CLIENT_ID`

6. Enter the **Certificate fingerprint**:
`A6:14:84:AC:34:55:FA:14:87:19:15:81:67:77:D2:59:EB:13:4B:FC`

7. Enter the **Remote logout URL** (be sure to replace the ACCOUNT_NAME placeholder with your Zendesk account name, which will usually be the first segment in your Zendesk URL (for example, https://{accountname}.zendesk.com)):
`https://${account.namespace}/v2/logout/?returnTo=https://ACCOUNT_NAME.zendesk.com`

:::note
You can use any URL for the `returnTo` parameter, but you must set it as an **Allowed Logout URL** in [**Auth0 Dashboard** > **Tenant Settings** > **Advanced**](https://${manage_url}/#/tenant/advanced). The example above uses your Zendesk home.
:::

8. Click **Save**. SAML SSO is now configured, but it is not automatically enabled for Zendesk users. To allow users to sign in with SSO, [enable external authentication in Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203663676#topic_b15_1gd_jhb).
