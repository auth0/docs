# Configure SSO Integration for Salesforce

The Salesforce Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Salesforce. Your users log in to Salesforce with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
