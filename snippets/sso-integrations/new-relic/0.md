# Configure SSO Integration for New Relic

The New Relic Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for New Relic. Your users log in to New Relic with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.

To learn more, read [Single Sign-On Integrations](https://auth0.com/docs/sso). If you need details about other integrations, review [Connections](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders).
