#### AD RMS SSO integration

Before you continue, make sure you have your SSO integration Client ID. You will use the Client ID to replace the `SSO_CLIENT_ID` placeholders.

1. Add Federation Support to your AD RMS Cluster

2. Enter your Auth0 **RMS URL** (be sure to replace the SSO_CLIENT_ID placeholder with the Client ID of your SSO Integration):
`${account.namespace}/rms/SSO_CLIENT_ID`

Make sure you validate the URL to verify connectivity.
