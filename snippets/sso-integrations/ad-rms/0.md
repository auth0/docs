# Configure SSO Integration for AD RMS

The AD RMS Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for AD RMS. Your users log in to AD RMS with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.

To learn more, read [Single Sign-On Integrations](https://auth0.com/docs/sso). If you need details about other integrations, review [Connections](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders).
