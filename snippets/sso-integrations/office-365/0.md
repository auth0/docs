# Configure SSO Integration for Office 365

The Office 365 Single Sign-on (SSO) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Office 365. Your users log in to Office 365 with Auth0 identity providers, which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
