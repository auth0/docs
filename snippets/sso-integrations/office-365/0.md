# Configure SSO Integration for Office 365

The Office 365 [Single Sign-on (SSO)](https://auth0.com/docs/sso) Integration creates a client application that uses Auth0 for authentication and provides SSO capabilities for Office 365. Your users log in to Office 365 with Auth0 [identity providers](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), which means the identity provider performs the identity credentials verification.
