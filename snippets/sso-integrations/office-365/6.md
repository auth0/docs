#### Office 365 Azure Active Directory Integration

Before you configure Auth0 with Azure AD:

* Make sure you are using an Office 365 edition that supports this integration. Currently, **Midsize** Business and any **Enterprise** [editions of Office 365](https://office.microsoft.com/en-us/business/compare-office-365-for-business-plans-FX102918419.aspx) support SSO with Auth0. 
* Verify your Office 365 domain through DNS. Follow [Mircrosoft's instructions](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/gather-the-information-you-need-to-create-office-365-dns-records-77f90d4a-dc7f-4f09-8972-c1b03ea85a67).
* Have one administrator account that you can use to sign in directly into Office 365.
* Run Microsoft Azure AD Connect between your Active Directory and Office 365 to create your user accounts. You can [download Azure AD Connect from the Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=47594).
